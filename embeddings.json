The report predicts that almost two-fifths (37%) of new workers will require higher education of level 6 and above qualifications. This figure has increased from 29% of the first iteration of the Skills Barometer (2015-2025), providing clear evidence that our students are in demand, and they need to be employability ready. The programmes aim to prepare students for employment and career advancement in the diverse spectrum of careers within the bio- and healthcare science sector. Ulster University (UU) has embarked on a new and ambitious plan with a strategic vision People, Place and Partnerships, delivering sustainable futures for all identifies including: collaboration, enhancing potential, inclusion and integrity. The programmes outlined within this document meet the University\u2019s vision and mission: \u201cAs Northern Ireland\u2019s civic university, Ulster University will deliver outstanding research and teaching that encourages the innovation, leadership and vision needed to help our community thrive\u201d. This vision is reflected in the People, Place and Partnership Strategy with our nine commitments: Placing sustainability at the centre of what we do; Providing vibrant campus based higher education; Enhancing the social life of our campuses; Maintaining a multicampus model for our region-wide delivery; Investing in a broad-based research-led higher education offering; Being a key partner for industry; Being a key partner for the cultural and social life of our communities; Helping our staff achieve a work-life balance that allows them to flourish. https://www.ulster.ac.uk/people-place-and-partnership/strategy The programmes described here are also designed to meet UU's Student Learning Experience Principles. Key among these, UU\u2019s Learning Model advises that: UU students will be at the heart of the learning experience. UU students will engage in a collaborative, learner-centred, active, and participative environment, with opportunities for inter-disciplinary learning where appropriate. Learner-centred teaching will promote inquiry-based learning methods to facilitate exploration, innovation, critical-thinking, leadership and problem-solving. Learning will be facilitated through critical reflection of transformative learning experiences individually and in teams. UU students and staff will be engaged in a learning community, which facilitates the transition through programmes of study and onto employment. In embracing and implementing such aims, each of the programmes in this document seeks to enhance the student experience by providing excellent flexible and accessible learning opportunities that are student-centred, that challenge the students intellectually through research- and scholarship-led education, and enhance their core skills with a focus on employability in the bioscience sector, thus contributing to the economic development of this important sector within the Northern Ireland economy and further afield.

seeks to enhance the student experience by providing excellent flexible and accessible learning opportunities that are student-centred, that challenge the students intellectually through research- and scholarship-led education, and enhance their core skills with a focus on employability in the bioscience sector, thus contributing to the economic development of this important sector within the Northern Ireland economy and further afield. Curriculum Design Principles In preparing for revalidation, the course team has taken cognisance of the UU\u2019s Curriculum Design Principles framework Regulatory Framework (ulster.ac.uk) listed below. Employability ready Entrepreneurship Work-based learning Internationalization Interprofessional Education Widening participation. Research informed teaching Active learning via various pedagogies Information and digital literacy Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Health and Safety and Wellbeing Sustainability The principles will be further articulated throughout the document and will highlight the team\u2019s strengths in delivering programmes that are responsive to the needs of students who aspire to work in the biomedical sciences area. The programmes are delivered on-campus and/or through BB Learn online digital platform which facilitates flexible engagement with course material using a variety of pedagogies for learning. The majority of our staff are research active, thus ensuring that the curriculum is informed by the most recent advances in the field. Where possible 20 credit point modules are used throughout each programme to align with the recommended 200 hours undergraduate level of learning and teaching. Learning outcomes are identified in each module descriptor to guide students in their learning, in that they explain what is expected of them, in turn helping them to succeed in their studies. Additionally, they help module coordinators focus on exactly what they would feel the students need to achieve in terms of both knowledge and skills. The number of learning outcomes is limited to four per module to make it easier to design aligned learning and teaching activities and assessment tasks. The team have taken a constructive alignment approach in designing the curriculum to ensure that assessment is effective in determining student-learning gain against the defined learning outcomes. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Graduate Attributes (GA) A key part of the curriculum which also must be considered is on the aspects of biomedical science and the impact on health, biodiversity and sustainable futures. UU Graduate Attributes strategic objectives, \u2018Nurturing success for every healthcare student\u2019 will be focused upon with the introduction of UU\u2019s new strategy: People, Place and Partnership. UU\u2019s Environmental Sustainability Statement outlines our commitment to becoming a more environmentally responsible regulator. \u2018\u2019All organisations have a part to play in protecting the environment, reducing their carbon footprint, consumption of resources.\u2019\u2019 The statement lists the actions we plan to take in support of these commitments. Environmental impact on health and communities, accountability, health inequalities including good health and wellbeing and quality education are examples of how we plan to align each of our modules with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a way that facilitates Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) (Table A1). Students are encouraged to think critically, reflect and select the SDGs which they themselves believe are relevant to the context of their learning and teaching within the module. Full details of Ulster\u2019s SDG policy at: https://www.ulster.ac.uk/sustainability. The aim will be to enhance the learning and teaching, and social experience of our students through the creation and dissemination of knowledge and competency as part of their society, cultural life, and the economy. In doing so, UU will be committed to providing equality of opportunity for both staff and students, creating an environment which places diversity, inclusion and wellbeing at the heart of our culture. Furthermore, the biomedical science programmes will continue to develop and support both interprofessional and sustainability initiatives with our staff, students, and external partners across various aspects of teaching, research, and professional services operations. All students are afforded the required information technology support available within the UU Office for Digital Learning and will be equipped with knowledge and skills that promote the qualities of global citizenship, ethical leadership and a commitment to lifelong learning, professionalism and employability. Table A1: Sustainable Development Goals (STGs) embedded within the biomedical science programmes. In seeking revalidation of the programmes, the Subject Team has drawn on standards policies and publications (Table A2). Table A2: Standards policies and publications. A2: Projected intakes Since revalidation in 2018 the Biomedical Science suite of programmes have continued to attract high numbers of applications from the United Kingdom (UK), the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and overseas (Table A3). There has remains a steady popularity and student intake into undergraduate Biomedical Science programmes, with excellent progression statistics (Table A4). Recruitment onto the undergraduate programmes is aligned with the School\u2019s allocation of additional capped STEM student numbers (MaSN). Close engagement with our School Liaison Officers, the Employer\u2019s Liaison Board (ELB) and other stakeholders has helped us identify and target prospective students, across the UK, ROI and overseas, developing and providing flexible study opportunities in the process. BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology) is a high demand programme, however it has been necessary to cap student numbers to approximately 25 students annually as a direct result of inherent external limits on the number of approved pathology training places (sandwich placement year). The Biomedical Science degree programmes are offered at UU at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. Full time undergraduate degree programmes in biomedical science are catered for on the UU Coleraine campus, whilst the part time undergraduate and masters\u2019 programmes are taught online. The School of Biomedical Sciences has been at the forefront of developing distance learning for over 25 years and has embraced the potential of distance learning to improve access, widen participation and support an increasingly diverse student base. All programmes for revalidation are hosted on the Blackboard Learn Virtual Learning BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology): The BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science with Diploma in Professional Practice in Pathology (DPP Pathology) is conferred on students who satisfactorily complete a period of integrated training (Sandwich Placement Year 3)", "extract": "embracing and implementing such aims, each of the programmes in this document seeks to enhance the student experience by providing excellent flexible and accessible learning opportunities that are student-centred, that challenge the students intellectually through research- and scholarship-led education, and enhance their core skills with a focus on employability in the bioscience sector, thus contributing to the economic development of this important sector within the Northern Ireland economy and further afield.

Full time undergraduate degree programmes in biomedical science are catered for on the UU Coleraine campus, whilst the part time undergraduate and masters\u2019 programmes are taught online. The School of Biomedical Sciences has been at the forefront of developing distance learning for over 25 years and has embraced the potential of distance learning to improve access, widen participation and support an increasingly diverse student base. All programmes for revalidation are hosted on the Blackboard Learn Virtual Learning BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology): The BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science with Diploma in Professional Practice in Pathology (DPP Pathology) is conferred on students who satisfactorily complete a period of integrated training (Sandwich Placement Year 3) in an Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) approved clinical laboratory. Students on this programme complete the IBMS Registration Training Portfolio, and upon successful completion and independent verification are issued with the IBMS Certificate of Competence. The IBMS Registration Training Portfolio is set against the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) Standards of Proficiency, for which the HCPC accepts for the purposes of registering Biomedical Scientists. Since the first approval of the co-terminus degree (with integrated training year) in 2005, the Subject Team has worked closely with the IBMS both locally and nationally, and with the employers from the Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Trusts. The close cooperation in the development of procedures and processes has enabled us to facilitate robust and autonomous management of clinical placements and thus direct approval from the HCPC for this programme. This programme provides an academically challenging and vocationally relevant science education, particularly for those wishing to follow careers in a clinical/pathology laboratory, and thus is required to produce competent HCPC registered Biomedical Scientists to meet regional and national needs. Presently, the DPP Pathology programme has direct approval from the HCPC and is accredited by the IBMS. BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DPP/DIAS): The BSc Hons Biomedical Science degree with Diploma in Professional Practice/ Diploma in International Academic Studies (DPP/DIAS) continues to be a popular choice with applicants, preparing students to work in biomedical science in the widest context, and to pursue postgraduate qualifications at UU and other HE Institutions, both at home and abroad. A major strength of the DPP/DIAS programme is the integrated sandwich placement year which affords students the opportunity to work outside the University for one year and gain experience in their chosen field either within the United Kingdom (UK) or United States of America (USA) (under Business Education Initiative, BEI, in the case of DIAS). This expertise is further developed in the final year of study through the \u2018Investigative Project\u2019 module. Additionally, the DPP/DIAS qualification meets the IBMS accreditation requirements, and thus graduates may still pursue a career as a Biomedical Scientist following an appropriate period of additional training within an IBMS approved pathology laboratory with attainment of the IBMS Certificate of Competence. BSc Hons Biomedical Science: The BSc Hons Biomedical Science programme delivers identical academic content, knowledge and practical components as the DPP/DIAS programme, with the exception that students are not required to undertake a sandwich placement year. This programme offers full-time (three- years) and part-time (typically up to six-years) and was introduced to meet student demand for a programme, without the need to undertake a sandwich placement, and continues to have a high student intake level annually. Some students prefer not to commit to undertaking a year- long placement until they have a clearer idea of which career pathways they wish to pursue, and this programme helps facilitate this need. The three-year programme also provides a qualification that meets the IBMS accreditation requirements, thus similar to the DPP/DIAS programme, graduates may still pursue a career as a Biomedical Scientist following an appropriate period of additional training within an IBMS approved pathology laboratory with attainment of the IBMS Certificate of Competence. BSc Hons Biomedical Science (Distance Learning): This programme integrates theory and practice in a range of biomedical science subjects and complementary research studies taught by distance learning (DL). This programme was introduced primarily to support the career development of associate practitioners in the NHS pathology workforce. The overall purpose of the course is to provide an academically challenging and vocationally relevant science education for those Foundation Degree in Applied and Medical Sciences, Biomedical Sciences, Biosciences or Healthcare Sciences graduates or equivalent sub-degree graduates working in a clinical healthcare setting in Life Sciences, the pharmaceutical industry or other areas of biomedical science, producing competent graduates to meet local regional and national needs. The course aims to meet the academic requirements for HCPC registration as a Biomedical Scientist. Such provision can assist employees in advancing through the healthcare scientist career pathway, thereby providing a clear direction for workforce planning and sustainability in the profession. This course is a valuable addition to Ulster\u2019s selection of high-quality IBMS-accredited DL courses. Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science: UU has offered an IBMS-accredited Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science programme to graduates possessing a relevant/equivalent non accredited BSc degree. The \u2018top-up\u2019 curriculum of modules enables students to meet the requirements eligible for HCPC registration. The Graduate Certificate programme therefore offers specialisation in key pathology disciplines inclusive of cellular pathology, molecular pathology, clinical biochemistry, haematology and transfusion, immunology, and microbiology. The programme is delivered fully on-line and asynchronously, thereby enabling easy and flexible access for Hospital Laboratory employees such as Health Care Assistants and Biomedical Scientists, globally, to the knowledge in a geographically and temporally independent manner. The completion of the educational requirements, accompanied by the IBMS Certificate of Competence, grants eligibility for registration with the HCPC. The current model of residential practical classes and/or the fulfilment of the practical requirements in the employee\u2019s laboratory has proven popular and successful and will continue for the Graduate Certificate with expansion as required. Master of Biomedical Science (BiomedSci): The School of Biomedical Sciences has a comprehensive suite of degree programmes which cater for the developing, professional Biomedical Scientist.

globally, to the knowledge in a geographically and temporally independent manner. The completion of the educational requirements, accompanied by the IBMS Certificate of Competence, grants eligibility for registration with the HCPC. The current model of residential practical classes and/or the fulfilment of the practical requirements in the employee\u2019s laboratory has proven popular and successful and will continue for the Graduate Certificate with expansion as required. Master of Biomedical Science (BiomedSci): The School of Biomedical Sciences has a comprehensive suite of degree programmes which cater for the developing, professional Biomedical Scientist. As previously discussed, within undergraduate programmes, opportunities exist for students to undertake industrial or research- based placements. For students taking the three-year undergraduate Biomedical Science programme, however, an opportunity for students to gain extensive international research experience is recognised, promoting introduction of the Master of Biomedical Science (MBiomedSci) (Integrated Master\u2019s) programme in Biomedical Science. The MBiomedSci programme is however offered to students undertaking all existing BSc Hons Biomedical Science programmes. Following successful completion of a 12-month internship in a research laboratory, these students can complete the necessary components for the Integrated Master\u2019s award. Origin of BSc Hons Biomedical Science Programmes Since the introduction of the BSc Hons Medical Laboratory Sciences programme in 1980, Ulster University has offered academically relevant degrees to facilitate graduate employment as Biomedical Scientists within the NHS diagnostic laboratory service. UU was one of the first UK universities to offer such programmes, and the BSc Hons programme further evolved and changed and was retitled BSc Hons Biomedical Science and validated and accredited by the University and IBMS, respectively, and approved by the then Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine (CPSM) in 1987 with the first graduates of the revised four-year programme (that included a sandwich placement year) in 1991. As noted in the above rationale this has now evolved into a suite of Biomedical Science courses which offer flexible learning opportunities to a wide range of prospective students, encouraging widening participation and lifelong learning in support of education and career development. Origin of Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science Following introduction of the HPC (now HCPC) Standards of Proficiency for Biomedical Scientists in 2004, the mechanism for trainee Biomedical Scientists who required additional qualifications to obtain HCPC registration changed significantly. The pre-existing \u2018top-up\u2019 routes (e.g. Postgraduate Certificate in Biomedical Sciences) were replaced with individual assessments by the IBMS. The resulting report informed the individual in question of additional study modules that they were required to complete in order to eligible for HCPC registration. This presented several inherent challenges for employees (such as the timing of the release of the reports), prompting Ulster\u2019s introduction of the Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science in 2006. The DL/PT modality helped to provide learning opportunities for individuals accounting for the typical challenging commitments of full/part-time employment, together with caring responsibilities, and thus enabling a study/work/family/caring balance. Origin of MBiomedSci Biomedical Science: UU has a very successful relationship with a number of prestigious United States of America (USA) universities who have offered research-intensive \u2018internships. Particularly strong links with Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) have been developed. These include 12-month internships with bursary support and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the School of Biomedical Sciences. The MBiomedSci programme has utilised this infrastructure successfully for several years to accept students wishing to undertake research projects for the same duration at Master\u2019s Level.

Projected intakes from AY 2024-2025: It is projected that all programmes will continue to attract high quality applicants and that the student numbers indicated in the MaSN and non-MaSN Academic Plan will be met each year. Projected numbers are as indicated in Table A5. Table A5: Projected numbers for 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 (all programmes) Course intakes will be reviewed annually, with minimum/maximum course numbers determined in line with the current academic plan for the School of Biomedical Sciences The number of students for each course will be determined by a number of factors, including staffing, on-campus teaching facilities, capability for quality project provision and number of placements available. In the case of BSc Hons Applied Biomed Science (DPP Pathology), for example, the current maximum number is 25 students, which is the number of placements offered by the Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Trusts. Similarly, the current maximum number for MSci Biomedical Science is 5 students, which is the number of places available with our USA partner for the integrated research year. As a distance-learning provision, the Grad Cert course is a scalable programme, with appropriate e-tutor support added for every 25 students in place. Destination of graduates: Consistent with UU\u2019s aims of delivering outstanding research and teaching that encourages the innovation, leadership needed to help our community thrive, the School is fully committed to supporting graduates gain stimulating and fulfilling employment. As such, the School\u2019s objective is to provide students with learning experiences that give them the confidence, knowledge and skills to enable them to take up stimulating, challenging, and fulfilling employment opportunities and to contribute to the further development and advancement of their chosen profession. Employability and professional practice are embedded into all courses with support for all students, including those with disabilities. Professional accreditation of biomedical science programmes helps best ensure that students can pursue a career pathway in the bio- and healthcare science sector. To this end, the School has longstanding reputation for research-driven teaching and learning, producing highly employable graduates, and Ulster sustains an excellent reputation with the vast majority of students directly entering employment (or engaging in further study and/or research) upon graduation. The most recent data collected from the Destination of Leavers of Higher Education (DLHE) survey (2020-2021) supports this claim with a high percentage of graduates progressing to full-time employment of further study (Table A6).

Professional accreditation of biomedical science programmes helps best ensure that students can pursue a career pathway in the bio- and healthcare science sector. To this end, the School has longstanding reputation for research-driven teaching and learning, producing highly employable graduates, and Ulster sustains an excellent reputation with the vast majority of students directly entering employment (or engaging in further study and/or research) upon graduation. The most recent data collected from the Destination of Leavers of Higher Education (DLHE) survey (2020-2021) supports this claim with a high percentage of graduates progressing to full-time employment of further study (Table A6). A significant proportion of our graduates are employed as biomedical scientists either in the UK or the Republic of Ireland (examples include NHS Pathology Laboratories, Blood Transfusion Service). A large number of our graduates are employed in research laboratories (examples include local and global industrial, pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies). Many of our graduates also take up further education and training opportunities such as MSc, MRes, PhD and PGCE. Of particular note is that in the most recent Destination of Leavers of Higher Education (DLHE) survey (2020-2021), the percentage of graduates who were in professional employment from the Biomedical Sciences three-year programme (67.45%) and Biomedical Sciences DPP (Pathology) (92.86%), increased significantly by 21.45% and 25.86% respectively, since 2016-2017 evidencing the strong employability potential of our graduate students. Although Biomedical Sciences (DPP) (54.55%) programmes was lower than 2016-2017 (68%), there showed to be a 13.36% increase of students participating in further study (36.36%) with students showing more a research interest from their DPP/DIS/DIAS placement experience. Table A6. Destination of Biomedical Sciences Leavers as at 2020/2021 Further evidence for student satisfaction with our undergraduate programmes comes from the most recent National Student Survey (NSS) results (Table A7), which demonstrates a Student Satisfaction significantly higher for all 3 programmes than both the University overall and the UK sector, with two achieving a maximum score of 100%. We are delighted with the excellent results from the Guardian League Tables 2024 for Biomedical Science being voted as Number 2 in the UK and the number 1 IBMS accredited course in the UK. https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng interactive/2017/may/16/university-guide- 2018league-table-for-biosciences Table A7. National Student Survey results * N/A Did not participate A3 Contextualised Research and Analysis: Standards and Quality Indicators All programmes described herein align with Ulster\u2019s Research Nexus Learning Principle which states: \u2018Ulster students will experience research and/or scholarship-informed teaching to gain the skills to demonstrate critical intellectual enquiry in their taught courses to enable them to become independent learners and progress to their chosen careers and/or as a preparation for further study or research.\u2019 Further information is available at https://www.ulster.ac.uk/learningenhancement/resources/integrating-research-and-teaching Since revalidation in 2018 the Biomedical Science suite of programmes have continued to attract high numbers of applications from the UK, the ROI and overseas. Importantly, staff within the Bio- and Healthcare Science Subject Team are highly committed to the integration of teaching and research. Within our programmes students are introduced to the foundational principle that research and scholarship are fundamental to learning and practice. The importance of using reliable, peer-reviewed scientific information to inform learning is conveyed throughout our programmes. The majority of staff within the Bio- and Healthcare Sciences Subject Team are internationally recognised experts within their research area and are research active members of the Biomedical Sciences Research Institute (BMSRI). In the recent Research Excellence Framework (REF2021) exercise, Biomedical Sciences was awarded top- ranking in the UK for world-leading Research Environment, with a score of 100% 4* (world leading), thus providing an exceptional training environment for young researchers. Furthermore, 95% of our research impact was also scored world-leading or internationally excellent. Current research within the Bio- and Healthcare Sciences Subject Team contributes to the evidence-base used to underpin teaching at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Furthermore, students are actively encouraged and supported to disseminate research findings from their Investigative Projects to external audiences e.g. at the annual Northern Ireland Science Festival and UK IBMS Congress each year. A4 Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies The aims and objectives of the programmes, their learning outcomes, the teaching and learning methods and the forms of assessment adopted are in accordance with: The University\u2019s Vision and Core Strategic Aims, Learning and Teaching Strategy and Policies QAA Subject Benchmark Statement for Biomedical Science, March 2023 QAA Subject Benchmark Statement for Biosciences, March 2023 Requirements of the Professional Bodies as specified in the Course Validation Guidance for Applicants issued by the IBMS. HCPC Standards of Proficiency and Standards of Education and Training National and University Qualifications and Credit Frameworks. The BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology) programme meets the requirements of the HCPC Standards of Education and Training (SETS; Appendix 4) and HCPC Standards of Proficiency (Appendix 5). Evidence of HCPC approval is provided in Appendix 6. For the MBiomedSci programme, cognisance has been taken of the QAA Benchmark Statement for Master\u2019s Degree Characteristics February 2020 (Available at http://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/quality-code/master's-degree- characteristicsstatement.pdf?sfvrsn=6ca2f981_10 ). The Subject Team carry out regular internal monitoring, primarily through the Subject Committee meetings which take place annually. These reports are provided in Appendix 9. Additionally, staff annually review the content of modules within the various programmes in line with developments in practice and research. The BSc Hons Biomedical Science and MBiomedSci degree programmes have two external examiners (one external examiner for Graduate Certificate) who submit an Annual Report to the University (included in accompanying documentation). Both external examiners for the BSc Hons Biomedical Science programmes are HCPC registered and specifically examines Year 2 specialism modules and placement Portfolios. Any concerns raised by the external examiner(s) are discussed at Subject Committees and a response is prepared and sent to the external examiner explaining how concerns have/will be met (see Appendix 10 for external reports and responses (Appendix 10) and previous Subject Committee minutes (Appendix (9). The response to the external examiner(s) report is also discussed at the Staff-Student Consultative Committee (Appendix 11).

Both external examiners for the BSc Hons Biomedical Science programmes are HCPC registered and specifically examines Year 2 specialism modules and placement Portfolios. Any concerns raised by the external examiner(s) are discussed at Subject Committees and a response is prepared and sent to the external examiner explaining how concerns have/will be met (see Appendix 10 for external reports and responses (Appendix 10) and previous Subject Committee minutes (Appendix (9). The response to the external examiner(s) report is also discussed at the Staff-Student Consultative Committee (Appendix 11). The University Centre for Quality Enhancement (CAQE) is also responsible for the annual monitoring of our taught courses delivered on campus. A copy of the chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.ulster.ac.uk/ data/assets/pdf_file/0007/323791/Principles.pdf is available. All of the biomedical science programmes offered within the School are closely linked with their respective Professional and Statutory and Regulatory Bodies. In particular, the BSc (Hons) Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology) programme is accredited by the IBMS, approved by the ACSLM and is acceptable for the purposes of registration with the HCPC. All of our other degree programmes are accredited by the IBMS. The Subject team has good working relationships with the local NI branch of the IBMS where Professor Declan McKenna (Associate Head of School) and Dr Valerie Hinch (Course Director) are active members of the committee. Members of the profession working in hospital laboratories contribute to our committees and actively contribute to many of our taught modules, career events, interviews, and research projects. Course design and development is discussed at the Employers Liaison Board (ELB; see Appendix 12) which meets at least once per semester. Members of the Subject Team regularly attend ACSLM and IBMS congresses and the University also has representation on the NI Pathology Network committee and the NI Biobank Steering Committee. IBMS, ACSLM and HCPC will be consulted prior to the implementation of any major changes proposed. For HCPC Approval The course team has ensured that the course continues to meet the HCPC standards of education and training (SETs) and Standards of Proficiency (SOPs) https://www.hcpcuk.org/standards/standards-of-proficiency/biomedical-scientists/. HCPC approval has been granted in the most recent annual monitoring exercise (June 2022) (Appendix 6).The updated standards of proficiency have now come into effect from 1 September 2023. It is now every registrant\u2019s responsibility to meet the updated standards, as far as they relate to their scope of practice. A5 Creativity, Innovation and Good Practice The Subject Team strives to promote and foster creativity in curriculum design and delivery in alignment with the People, Place and Partnership Strategy. The current educational and economic climate requires that we employ efficient, effective teaching practice that enhances the student experience. The Subject Team uses technology where appropriate, to enhance teaching and learning and challenge and empower students to take ownership of their own learning. Staff are encouraged and supported to use the resources within the VLE (BBLearn) to promote independent student-centred learning, including rubrics, self-assessment tools, and audio feedback tools. Indeed, student engagement within lectures has been a focus in recent years, exemplified by the widespread use of audience response system Turning Point. A number of colleagues avail of training in the use of the technology at the start of each academic year and students have commented favourably on this approach which provides opportunity for self-assessment, reflection, and instant feedback even in a large lecture setting. With a greater institutional and sector-wide focus on assessment and feedback a number of innovations have been implemented which derive from existing pedagogy the scholarship of teaching and learning. These include audio feedback, screencast video feedback, and use of text messaging and peer marking. Some colleagues have developed approaches for active learning within large lecture settings by using cloud-based audience response systems such as Response ware, Nearpod, Menti, Smart works and VeVox. These tools have greater functionality compared with voting handsets or voting using text messaging and give student opportunity to answer MCQs, provide short answers, annotate drawings, or complete calculations. These approaches allow for self- assessment and reflection of learning in large classes. The online collaborative tool Peer Wise has been used in some modules to encourage peer learning. It has been used extensively in BMS102 Biochemistry where students create and share multiple-choice questions based upon the course material. Given the large number of students on this module, this builds into a large repository of MCQs that can be used for revision purposes. Some of these are selected by the module co-coordinator for inclusion in summative class tests that take place during the semester. Some of these interventions have attracted funding internally from the Centre for Higher Education Research and Practice (CHERP) at Ulster, JISC TechDis HEAT3 and the Higher Education Academy (HEA), now part of Advance HE. The practice emanating from these has been disseminated at learning and teaching conferences on a local and national level. Much of the practice is now embedded within existing modules on the programs of study. The research and scholarship expertise of the diverse Subject Team is highlighted in staff CVs available in Section C. As evidence of good practice, several members of the Subject team have been awarded CHERP (Ulster) Development Funding, Teaching Development Grants from the Higher Education Academy of from the JISC TechDis HEAT3 Scheme. This funding has supported innovations in the following areas: Developing staff skills and understanding in using problem-based learning (PBL) Using text messaging for student communication, in-class voting and feedback using Menti and VeVox tools Facilitating recorded lectures and audio feedback to students The use of reflective video logs in chemistry practical classes and placement reflection classes Engagement of employers and career spotlight events, together with widening access of schools in the local area Interprofessional Education workshops Staff have also developed projects to enhance active learning approaches within the School and received funding from CHERP.

This funding has supported innovations in the following areas: Developing staff skills and understanding in using problem-based learning (PBL) Using text messaging for student communication, in-class voting and feedback using Menti and VeVox tools Facilitating recorded lectures and audio feedback to students The use of reflective video logs in chemistry practical classes and placement reflection classes Engagement of employers and career spotlight events, together with widening access of schools in the local area Interprofessional Education workshops Staff have also developed projects to enhance active learning approaches within the School and received funding from CHERP. Case studies of good practice are presented internally (e.g. Faculty away day, Office of Digital Learning training events, Interprofessional Education workshops and podcasts) together with externally (e.g. HEA conferences such as that of the IBMS Congress). Furthermore, sharing modules with cognate courses from the School of Biomedical Sciences provides the opportunity for students and lecturer to interact with their peers from other disciplines and professions and promotes multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary curriculum innovation and programme provision. Staff and placement providers have been successful in the annual UU Impact Excellence Awards, which recognise the good practice in our civic partnerships, as well as the positive impact our students and academic staff are having on both local and international societies and economies. Several staff have been recognised for their teaching excellence in the annual Ulster University Student\u2019s Union Learning & Teaching Awards, which are voted for by the students. Three members of the course team are Fellows of the Centre for Higher Education Research and Practice (CHERP) at Ulster. A further three colleagues have been recognised for excellence in teaching through the Ulster University Distinguished Teaching Fellowship Awards. One colleague has been awarded a Professional Practice Innovation Award in the inaugural Ulster Distinguished Education Excellence awards. Colleagues within the School actively engage with the Higher Education Academy by attending, presenting, and facilitating events held under the auspices of HEA. Colleagues have presented at the HEA Annual Conference, HEA STEM Conference, HEA Biosciences Summit and other locally organized HEA Workshops. Of the academic staff in the School of Biomedical Sciences, over 85% are recognised practitioners (members/fellow) of the Higher Education Academy, hold the Postgraduate Certificate in University Teaching or Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education Practice (PgCHEP), or hold an alternative equivalent qualification. There is one National Teaching Fellow (NTF) and eight Senior Fellows of the Higher Education Academy (SFHEA) within the School. Various course members hold other markers of professional esteem, including fellow of the IBMS (FIBMS), Chartered Biologist (CBiol), Chartered Scientist (refer to Section C3 for staff CVs for further details). Relationship with other programmes in School of Biomedical Sciences The School of Biomedical Sciences incorporates four sub-Schools namely: Bio- and Healthcare Sciences (Table A8); Biology; Food and Nutrition and Dietetics; Optometry.. Table A8: Programmes offered in Bio- and Healthcare Science sub-School * MSc in Biomedical Science was recently successfully revalidated and re-accredited by IBMS (2023) As noted previously, the School of Biomedical Sciences has successfully offered on-campus degree programmes in biomedical science for over 25 years including DL provision for some 25 years. This revalidation document extends former provision and capitalises on key strengths and markets to provide excellent student learning opportunities at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The commitment of UU to eLearning is evident from the central \u2018eLearning at Ulster\u2019 resource and UU\u2019s very public commitment to lifelong learning, Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and career progression in subjects that include biomedical science. The School has a dedicated eLearning Support Unit (eLSU) to facilitate administration and delivery of DL programmes and utilises subject expert e-Tutors to support students in their studies. Module Specific Changes In addition to the changes made since the last revalidation discussed at the end of Section B2 the following module proposals are seeking approval: BMS108 Scientific Communications and Biostatistics Module name change approval: It is proposed that this Level 4 module be renamed as 'Scientific Communication and Data Health Science' to fit in line with IBMS standards and student\u2019s understanding of data in health science. A review of the course curriculum, student feedback and employer advice also identified the need to update and consolidate first year teaching in the areas of professional skills, data handling and effective communication. The core, transferable skills learned in this module overseen by a new Module Co-ordinator in Scientific Communications and also delivered by a visiting HCPC registered Biomedical Scientist, together a new employed lecturer in Data and Health Science will provide students with a good basis for engaging with their future studies. BMS108 Scientific Communications and Biostatistics online Lectures and Practical classes approval: Prior to the Covid pandemic this module (weeks 7-12 ONLY) sessions were taught on campus along with Biology, Nutrition and Pharmacy programmes. Due to the high numbers of over 200 students, the sessions had to be repeated four times facilitated by the same demonstrators, which was very time consuming (sessions took almost a day and a half to complete all on campus practical sessions). During Covid, the teaching was held online able to be taught in one session with demonstrators supporting the students via breakout rooms, and so this has continued due to the effectiveness of the teaching and learning. Comparing to the on-campus experience, the teaching of the practical proved very effective and more organised due to the large numbers. Weekly tasks were completed and submitted at ease. The positive effectiveness was reflective via the feedback from both demonstrators and students. The change has been trial and tested and results have shown that marks have not decreased. Excel and SPSS are required for all assessments, however the software will have already been downloaded and on the student\u2019s device from the beginning of the teaching semester. Should a student request an on campus setting in order to facilitate a student\u2019s needs this can be organised. It has to be noted that a weekly catchup tutorial is held on", "extract": "Funding, Teaching Development Grants from the Higher Education Academy of from the JISC TechDis HEAT3 Scheme.

Comparing to the on-campus experience, the teaching of the practical proved very effective and more organised due to the large numbers. Weekly tasks were completed and submitted at ease. The positive effectiveness was reflective via the feedback from both demonstrators and students. The change has been trial and tested and results have shown that marks have not decreased. Excel and SPSS are required for all assessments, however the software will have already been downloaded and on the student\u2019s device from the beginning of the teaching semester. Should a student request an on campus setting in order to facilitate a student\u2019s needs this can be organised. It has to be noted that a weekly catchup tutorial is held on campus to support those students who require a little more help. BMS301 Cellular Pathology Assessment 100% Coursework approval: This level 5 module introduces core principles of Histopathology and Cytopathology, preparing the student for further in-depth study of disease processes within such disciplines. Visiting Biomedical Scientist lectures from NI hospital laboratories are employed part time to help demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the core scientific terminology and principles of Cellular Pathology that underpin clinical practice, and this has proven extremely effective based on the student annual module feedback. The 10-credit point module requires 100 hours of commitment, however, is taught within weeks S2 1-6 only. Placement employers have commented via their yearly placement feedback that the student\u2019s ability to compile scientific case reports could be strengthened, so that they are better prepared when entering placement in understanding clinical cases and the associated multidisciplinary input. An opportunity is to introduce coursework only so that the students can focus more time on their scientific writing skills, critical thinking and reflection via practical class case report assessments. The current class test would of course continue to strengthen their knowledge to ensure learning outcomes are tested and measured. BMS527 Cellular Pathology Assessment 100% Coursework approval: This module is part of the distance learning modules and mirrors that of BMS301, thus the same principle of assessments applies. As such, the assessment of case report writing would be more effective at meeting learning outcomes and assessing student\u2019s abilities enhancing their practice. As the module is a Level 6 with 15 credits, the expectations reflect the importance of a more critical approach to professional practice in Healthcare and Biomedical Science. As for BMS301 an opportunity is to introduce coursework only so that the students can focus more time on their scientific writing skills, critical thinking and reflection via their workplace assessments of case reports. The current class test would also continue to strengthen their knowledge to ensure learning outcomes are tested and measured. These students are full time employers and with the NHS challenges that lie ahead, this also may be an opportunity to support not only the student commitments, but the employer laboratories themselves. BMS504 Placement Preparation: Both DPP and 3-year programme have the opportunity to attend and seek placement regardless of being registered on the non-placement programme or not. This allows those students who otherwise may not have intended on going on placement seeing the world in a different light with the various placement opportunities. This opportunity is strongly encouraged by the Course Director and Career\u2019s team. This has proven successful with some students from the three-year programme optioning to proceed with industrial placement. Approval of transfer is confirmed at the examination boards in June and a simple transfer to the BSc Hons Biomedical Science with DPP DIS programme is completed. 3C1a Biomedical Science UG&PG SECTION B1 Programme Design (Commentaries) B1.1 Subject/Course Philosophy Design of the course curricula has taken place with reference to Ulster University (UU) Graduate Attributes (GAs) strategic objectives, People, Place and Partnership \u2018Nurturing success for every healthcare student\u2019 2023/24-2028/29, Ulster\u2019s Curriculum Design Principles framework, IBMS Guidance on Course Accreditation and Re-accreditation (Appendix 1), QAA Subject Benchmark Statements for Biomedical Science and Biosciences (Appendices 2 & 3), and HCPC Standards of Education & Training and Standards of Proficiency (Appendices 4 & 5). In preparation for this Revalidation event, the content of all modules has been reviewed to ensure that they are fit for purpose, updated in light of developments in biomedical science, and remain current. Programme revisions during the period of approval and which do not have substantial implications, are submitted to the Faculty for consideration and approval using Form CA3. All programmes specifically address the following Sustainable Development Goals: SDG3, SDG4, SDG5, SDG6, SDG8, SDG10, SDG11, SDG16, and SDG17. Key topics such as scientific communications and practical laboratory skills are introduced early in the undergraduate programmes (BMS108, BMS106, BMS105, BMS102, BMS104) and are further developed in discipline-specific modules (NUT301, BMS315, BMS335, BMS303, BMS301, BMS310). Advanced coverage of these topics is provided in modules BMS807, BMS505, and BMS806 clinical research projects. Our staff possess substantial expertise in these areas. The influence of partnerships and the promotion of good health and wellbeing are covered within the placement preparation and professional practice modules (BMS307 and BMS309) and are expanded upon in placement modules (BMS504 and BMS321).

Within our programmes, interactive and enquiry-based teaching and learning methods are employed to empower learners to reflect on their behaviour and take action for sustainable development, fostering \u2018global citizens\u2019 who strive to build a safer, more sustainable future. The development of the Graduate Attributes framework fits perfectly with UU values Ulster University's Values of integrity, collaboration, inclusion and enhancing potential within our undergraduate degree courses. Embracing the Integrated Curriculum Design Framework Integrated Curriculum Design Framework (ulster.ac.uk) curriculum domains of \u2018Knowing\u2019 \u2018Doing\u2019 and \u2018Being\u2019 (Barnett and Coate, 2005), can be viewed as areas where our students and graduates can see themselves as growing, developing, and improving. The framework is designed and presented in a way that maintains a sense of simplicity, is clear, easy to follow, engaging and encouraging. The following GAs are now applied within each module handbook (Appendix 16 Module Handbook exemplars) as shown in Table B1 and students are encouraged to think critically, reflect, and select the attributes which they themselves believe are relevant to the context of their learning and teaching within the module. Key: D = Developed A = Assessed Table B1: Graduate Attributes As the course involves active engagement with staff in hospitals, healthcare environments and bioscience industries, the work involved contributes to the sustainable knowledge we collectively create through invention and research in biomedical science for the wider benefit of society. The course thereby cultivates partnerships to develop infrastructure between education, public health and industry. We will continue to improve our global sustainability by working in partnership with our employees, communities, registrants, service users, suppliers, and other stakeholders. UU also run courses and research projects across a vast array of discipline areas including sustainable architecture, energy storage and renewable energy engineering, sustainable tourism, marine sciences, biomedical and health sciences, sustainable textiles, and law and human rights. An example of these is a free online \u2018Carbon Literacy\u2019 training course for both staff and students who receive a certificate on completion, also being Edge accredited. B1.2 Course Structure, Progression, Coherence, Choice Upon applicant admission, UU endeavours to make the transition period as smooth as possible to help students settle into their studies. Induction opportunities are provided for all new students providing them with information about their UU course, how it will be taught and assessed, regulations and facilities such as the library, career\u2019s service, computing facilities, student union and support wellbeing. The content of the courses remains unchanged except from updates annually to keep topics relevant and current. Course Directors are responsible for the day to day running of the programmes, monitoring, maintaining, as well as servicing the examination process and implementing any changes through the Course Committee. BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology) and BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DPP/DIAS / 3-year): The BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology) programme offers education and training necessary for Registration as a Biomedical Scientist with the HCPC. The HCPC SOPs and SETs for Biomedical Scientists are already integrated into the Applied Biomedical Science programme. The academic content provided in the BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science programme is identical to that provided in the BSc Hons Biomedical Science and BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DPP/DIAS) and thus all three programmes meet the requirements of those students who wish to pursue a career in industry or research. Year 1 The first year of all the undergraduate degree programmes provides underpinning in the fundamental sciences to enable a wider appreciation of the modules studied in subsequent years. In particular, there is a module of BMS105 Chemistry and Pharmacology and a further module BMS106 in Practical and Laboratory Skills which provide the scientific basis of many of the pathobiological mechanisms and laboratory instrumentation covered in subsequent years. There are also modules of BMS102 Biochemistry, BMS103 Human Physiology and Anatomy and BMS104 Medical Cell Biology, in addition to a module in BMS108 Scientific Communication and Biostatistics. The first year thus provides a strong base level of understanding and skills which will be reinforced and enhanced in subsequent skills. Year 2 Year two provides a fundamental understanding of the pathology and biology that underpins human disease(s). In addition to studying the traditional biomedical science subjects of BMS303 Haematology and Transfusion Science, BMS301 Cellular Pathology, BMS305 Clinical Biochemistry, BMS315 Microbiology, BMS335 Pathophysiology and NUT301 Immunology, students also study a module of BMS310 Applied Genetics where knowledge and hands-on experience of key techniques in molecular biology are provided. All students take a module of Professional Practice relevant to their particular degree programme (BMS309 Biomedical Professional Practice for Applied Biomedical Science students and BMS307 Professional Practice for the other two BSc Biomedical Science programmes). The professional aspects are delivered by practice educators such as invited guest lecturers working in relevant NHS pathology laboratories or bioscience industry. For DPP Pathology and DPP/DIAS students, tailored placement preparation classes are provided to prepare students for placement in Year 3. Some of these classes are conducted in collaboration with the Careers Development Centre to help embed employability within the course design. In order to accommodate the Professional Practice module, it is necessary to adopt some 10 credit modules in Year 2.This provision works well to reinforce teaching of pathology and Immunology topics across the year, as well as having the added benefit of allowing shared teaching and flexibility for students from other courses studying these modules. Year 3 Placement Students benefit by greatly improving their practical abilities, time management, organisational and interpersonal skills and hence their employability. Placement: Diploma in Professional Practice (Pathology) A 48-week Clinical placement in year 3 of the programme in an approved NHS Pathology or Agency laboratory, providing the student with training and support to facilitate successful completion of the registration portfolio. Students are eligible for HCPC registration as a Biomedical Scientist and licentiate membership of the IBMS, following successful completion of the registration portfolio and the degree programme and award of IBMS certificate of competence.

Year 3 Placement Students benefit by greatly improving their practical abilities, time management, organisational and interpersonal skills and hence their employability. Placement: Diploma in Professional Practice (Pathology) A 48-week Clinical placement in year 3 of the programme in an approved NHS Pathology or Agency laboratory, providing the student with training and support to facilitate successful completion of the registration portfolio. Students are eligible for HCPC registration as a Biomedical Scientist and licentiate membership of the IBMS, following successful completion of the registration portfolio and the degree programme and award of IBMS certificate of competence. Placement: Diploma in Professional Practice (Industry) Industrial placement provides a wide range of opportunities for students to experience professional work experience in an industrial or university environment. Placement: Diploma in International Academic Studies In this study programme students spend one year in another university, either in an EU country under the SOCRATES scheme or in the US under the Northern Ireland Business Education Initiative (BEI). This placement experience is designed to provide experience of an educational and cultural environment in an overseas country, the outcome being Placement: Diploma in International Academic Studies. Year Final The final year of the programme is in-depth study of human disease, informed to a large degree by the available research expertise within the School of Biomedical Sciences / Biomedical Sciences Research Institute. The modules are taught by researchers who are experts in their field. The teaching in final year is therefore very much research-based and research-driven. The modules are delivered by lecturers from the various research groups with expertise in Genomic Medicine, Diabetes, Stratified Medicine, Microbiology alongside other relevant pathology associated projects including Pharmaceutical Science, Nutrition, and Immunology, thereby providing an integrated approach to the study of pathophysiological phenomena. The delivery and content of the final year modules meets Benchmark Statement for Biomedical Science including Clinical Genetics. The BMS505 Investigative Project forms an important component of the Honours degree and introduces the student to the world of innovation and knowledge-led advances. The students spend a considerable period (40 credits over 2 semesters of study) of time working in one of the recognised Research Groups within the School. Final year students are encouraged to pursue their final year projects in their placement laboratory. Students are encouraged to identify a potential project and lab-based supervisor and consult closely with the Co-ordinator of the Investigative Project module prior to returning to final year.

Bridging curricula: Under the University\u2019s regulatory framework the model for progression from a Foundation degree to an Honours Degree involves some bridging between Level 5 and 6 with modules from 0 \u2013 120 credits. The amount of bridging required depends on the curriculum match. Furthermore, it is essential that any sub-degree graduate seeking to progress via an Honours degree towards healthcare science practitioner status meets the IBMS requirements in Human Physiology and Anatomy, and Molecular Biology and Genetics. The design of DL modules in Physiology and Anatomy of the Human Body (20 credit points at Level 4) and Molecular Biology and Genetics (20 credit points at Level 5), with practical sessions included, was deemed to be the best bridging solution for BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science (DL). New students engage in an online induction programme within BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science (DL), with the support of an e-tutor, during the semester. This helps them become effective online learners. Level 6 curricula: The internal coherence of the educational aims of the course and its associated learning outcomes at Level 6 across the specialisms in biomedical science, within an environment which promotes research, demand that all modules are compulsory, leaving no opportunities for student choice. Furthermore, experience of sub-degree graduates entering BSc (Hons) Applied Biosciences (DL) has shown that a compulsory set of Level 6 modules helps achieve a better fit between their prior learning and their degree studies, therefore facilitating a better performance in their degree studies. However, it must be stressed that students do exercise choice through selection of their research project. Normally, the research will take the form of a problem-solving, practice improvement or new opportunity realisation exercise within the students work-place or a case study or pilot survey or analysis of data arising from a scientific investigation in the field of biomedical science. A Level 6 Research Skills module, which covers research planning, carrying out a literature review, experimental design, data collection and analysis is a pre-requisite for the research module. The selection of following five Level 6 modules, which exist on the Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science, has strong justification in IBMS requirements and economy of effort for development and delivery: Medical Microbiology; Clinical Immunology; Cellular Pathology; Haematology and Transfusion Science; and Clinical Biochemistry. The selection of the Professional Practice in Healthcare Science module at Level 6", "extract": "the added benefit of allowing shared teaching and flexibility for students from other courses studying these modules.

analysis of data arising from a scientific investigation in the field of biomedical science. A Level 6 Research Skills module, which covers research planning, carrying out a literature review, experimental design, data collection and analysis is a pre-requisite for the research module. The selection of following five Level 6 modules, which exist on the Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science, has strong justification in IBMS requirements and economy of effort for development and delivery: Medical Microbiology; Clinical Immunology; Cellular Pathology; Haematology and Transfusion Science; and Clinical Biochemistry. The selection of the Professional Practice in Healthcare Science module at Level 6 reflects the importance of a critical approach to professional practice in Healthcare and Biomedical Science. The importance of understanding disease mechanisms and the pathology of body systems is recognised through the new Molecular Pathology module at Level 6. Successful students will exit with a BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science (DL). In addition, graduates exit with a transcript, which recognises they have successfully completed entrepreneurship training. 1668 Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science: The Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science provides a route to a Biomedical Science qualification for students who do not have an IBMS accredited primary degree. This programme offers a study programme leading to the award of Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science. This programme is offered part-time over 2 semesters by distance learning and accumulation of 60 credit points is necessary for award of the Graduate Certificate. There are optional taught modules on the programme. The programme has been designed to allow students to study one, two or three modules per semester. All Level 6 modules have equal credit weighting (15 Credits). The order of study depends on the chosen specialist module. In Semester 1, students can choose to study Medical Microbiology, Clinical Immunology and/or Haematology and Transfusion Science. In Semester 2, students can study Molecular Pathology, Clinical Biochemistry and/or Cellular Pathology. Three of the modules (Clinical Biochemistry, Cellular Pathology and Haematology and Transfusion Science) have laboratory-based practical sessions which can either be completed at the student\u2019s place of work (if appropriate) or during a residential at Ulster University teaching laboratories (usually one day for each module). A student may enrol on the course either before Semester 1 or 2, as two enrolment windows are available for this course. Students taking the course who wish to obtain the qualification of Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Sciences must complete at least 60 credit points and achieve an overall pass mark of 40% or more. Students who have an overall pass mark of 50% or more will graduate with a Graduate Certificate and have the option of proceeding to the PgD/MSc in Biomedical Sciences. The programme is accredited by the IBMS. All modules are delivered and assessed at Level 6 with the exception of a new module, Physiology and Anatomy of the Human Body (Level 4), which is included as this subject is often required by students in order to meet IBMS requirements for accreditation. Table B4 illustrates the Course Structure for Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science. Table B4: Course structure for 1668 Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science 7307 MBiomedSci: For students to transfer onto the MBiomedSci programme, they must have successfully completed all the taught elements of an undergraduate honours degree. Given that places on the programme are limited students must normally achieve 60% or equivalent in their honours degree. Students on the MBiomedSci programme will have the opportunity to work in a prestigious research laboratory for a period of 50 weeks in an area at the forefront of their discipline and develop the skills and techniques required of a professional researcher. Undertaking research at other prestigious Universities will also enable students to meet and engage with other researchers in their chosen research field. Where possible, students will be encouraged to avail of any experience of research within a clinical setting. Students commencing the fourth year of this programme will be enrolled on modules as DL students and will join the MSc Biomedical Science (DL) option in which students from all aspects of the biomedical science profession are enrolled. This will be particularly advantageous to BMiomedSci students as it will provide for them discussions with other professionals in different parts of the profession. Through discussion board exchanges, it is anticipated that the MBiomedSci students will develop an appreciation of employment opportunities in the biomedical sciences profession. Students on the MBiomedSci programme will enrol on a specialist module Stem Cell Biology and on the Applied Research Method, Advanced Scientific Methods and Medical Research Project modules. The research and scientific methods modules will be particularly relevant to these students, as they will be working full time in a research environment and will be able to directly use the information conveyed in these modules to enhance their on-going research methodologies. Students who complete this programme will thus develop the professionalism of an experienced researcher, the intellectual ability to design research programmes and the postgraduate knowledge of current developments in their chosen field. Table B5 illustrates the Course Structure for MBiomedSci (note this is in addition to BSc Hons Biomedical Science shown in Table B2). The MBiomedSci programme is an excellent opportunity for students to experience outward mobility and global networking. It therefore aligns itself well with Ulster\u2019s global internationalisation strategy, both in terms of student opportunity and inter-institutional increased research collaboration. Table B5: Course structure for 7307 MBiomedSci Course Transfer The similarity of the course programmes means that some transfer of students can take place throughout the academic year, subject to approval by course director. To streamline this process, final approval of students requesting transfer will take place at June exam boards. Furthermore, second year students on the 4-year programmes who have not secured a placement at this time will be automatically transferred to the 3-year programme. This will be made clear in the course documentation provided to students at the start of their studies.

It therefore aligns itself well with Ulster\u2019s global internationalisation strategy, both in terms of student opportunity and inter-institutional increased research collaboration. Table B5: Course structure for 7307 MBiomedSci Course Transfer The similarity of the course programmes means that some transfer of students can take place throughout the academic year, subject to approval by course director. To streamline this process, final approval of students requesting transfer will take place at June exam boards. Furthermore, second year students on the 4-year programmes who have not secured a placement at this time will be automatically transferred to the 3-year programme. This will be made clear in the course documentation provided to students at the start of their studies. It has to be noted the innovation of enabling year 2 3-year undergraduate programme students to attend the Year 2 DPP Placement Preparation classes in the off chance they may wish to apply for placement, has proven successful. If in doing so they can be transferred to the DPP placement course prior to them starting placement. Due to the specific nature of the modules on the programmes, students transferring into the programme will be required to undertake all core modules. The exemption will be students on the distance learning courses with previous qualifications which are recognised as equivalent to the modules, thus may be approved through the University\u2019s Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL) scheme. In terms of exemption, for each case, it is determined whether the certificated evidence is commensurate with the learning outcomes within the module(s) for which exemption is sought, in accordance with the Faculty APEL policy. Transfer (to and from other programmes of study and opportunities for progression to further study) BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology) and BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DPP/DIAS / 3-year): There is common teaching of modules undertaken in Year 1 of the BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology) programme, BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science (DPP/DIAS / 3-year) programmes and BSc Hons Dietetics, BSc Hons Human Nutrition, BSc Hons Food and Nutrition, and BSc Hons Biology. Therefore, students who enrol for these programmes in the School may seek transfer from one programme to another, subject to: Successful completion of the first year of the programme on which they are enrolled. Having studied the core modules for their newly chosen course Availability of places on the receiving programme Professional Body requirements Completion of relevant checks and health screens as appropriate. Interview with the Course Director This is in line with approved University policy of allowing delayed choice of course whenever possible. The exceptions to principle are transfer into BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology) as numbers of places are limited due to availability of clinical placements. Due to the specific nature of the modules on these programmes, students transferring into the programme will be required to undertake all core modules (unless previous qualifications are recognised as equivalent to the modules and are appropriate through the University\u2019s Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) Scheme). In terms of exemption, for each case, it is determined whether the certified evidence is commensurate with the learning outcomes within the module(s) for which exemption is sought, in accordance with the Ulster\u2019s Guiding Principles and Policy for the Accreditation of Prior Learning. Course transfer due to difficulties in obtaining placement has already been noted in Section B2.1 above. Students who obtain the required marks on BTEC Extended Diploma (Science), Foundation Degree in Applied Medical Science, Associate Bachelor\u2019s degree in Science or equivalent from Further Education Institutions may be considered for transfer to Year 2 of these programmes depending on the match of subject content of their course with that being offered in Year 1. All students are accepted in accordance with the APL Policy. Suitability qualified graduates from the BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science programmes have the opportunity to progress to the PgCE, MSc, MRes, and PhD programmes within the Ulster University and other Universities at home and abroad who deliver post-graduate education. BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DL): Given the professional nature of the BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DL) programme and entry at Level 6, there is no scope to transfer within the programme. Suitably qualified graduates from BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DL) have the opportunity to progress to PgDip, MSc, MRes and PhD programmes in Biomedical Science and related subjects within the Ulster University and other Universities both at home and abroad which deliver post-graduate education. Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science: Given the professional nature of the Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science programme there is no scope for transfer within the programme. MBiomedSci: Transfer to the MBiomedSci programme has already been described in \u2018Structure and Requirements for the Award\u2019. Suitably qualified graduates will have the opportunity to progress to MSc or PhD. Course name and code change: BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science DPP (Pathology) The Biomedical Science DPP (Pathology) programme has been renamed as Applied Biomedical Science DPP (Pathology). There are a number of reasons supporting this proposed change. Primarily, it is intended to distinguish this programme more clearly from the other two on- campus iomedical Science undergraduate programmes as one which offers education and training necessary for Registration as a Biomedical Scientist with the HCPC, principally due to the completion of an integrated placement year in an IBMS approved pathology laboratory. This programme attracts a high number of applicants each year, but numbers are limited to the availability of placements (approximately 25 each year). Moreover, the asking tariff points for this programme are normally exceeded by a significant margin, on average. Renaming as Applied Biomedical Science DPP (Pathology) further distinguishes the programme from the other biomedical science provisions within the School. The revised name has helped ensure prospective applicants more clearly recognise the distinction between our suite of biomedical science programmes, particularly in terms of placement provision, thereby avoiding any potential confusion caused by similar programme names.

This programme attracts a high number of applicants each year, but numbers are limited to the availability of placements (approximately 25 each year). Moreover, the asking tariff points for this programme are normally exceeded by a significant margin, on average. Renaming as Applied Biomedical Science DPP (Pathology) further distinguishes the programme from the other biomedical science provisions within the School. The revised name has helped ensure prospective applicants more clearly recognise the distinction between our suite of biomedical science programmes, particularly in terms of placement provision, thereby avoiding any potential confusion caused by similar programme names. B1.3 Student Support and Guidance, Induction, Study Skills School visits: Staff associated with the delivery of the courses continues to make regular visits to schools throughout the region. During these visits, the range and diversity of the courses on offer are described, course requirements are elucidated, and the potential career opportunities associated with individual courses are explained and discussed with the students and staff at schools. Pre-entry open days and Taster Days: All students who have applied and hold offers for the undergraduate programmes in the School are invited to an Open Day, held in September and February of the year prior to entry and which offers a tailored programme for both the students and their parents. Additionally, taster days are held during the October half term break inviting prospective students and with/without their parents to attend Biomedical science related workshops providing an insight of the profession. This enables applicants to meet staff (Course Director, Accommodation Officers, Recruitment Officers, current students) and other prospective students to enable them to gain additional information about the teaching and learning methods in the School, find out more about some of the research bring conducted in the School, establish the details of the programme content and approach taken to teaching, and confirm \u2018asking grades\u2019, details of finance, accommodation, sporting facilities etc. Registration on programmes: At registration, all new and returning students engage/reengage with the Course Director who leads the students through the enrolment process and provides advice and information. Each student has access to a detailed Programme Handbook. First year induction: An induction session is organised at the start of the academic year so that students will not only be aware of the various policies and procedures that they are expected to follow, but also the scope and sources of support that they may need as they establish themselves at the Ulster University, including a library induction. An ice-breaking \u2018 meet and greet\u2019 session is held in the School for students early in the first semester. This session, which normally takes the form of a table quiz in a suitable venue within the university, allows staff and students to engage with each other and enhance social interactions. DL students: Distance learners complete an online induction session in advance of the start of semester in order to introduce them to the BBLearn on-line learning environment and University resources including the library. Students on distance learning modules are supported by eTutors. eTutors are responsible for providing academic/administrative support to groups of 20-25 students. Professional/study skills: First year students are introduced to the Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) system during induction. HEAR is an online tool provided by the University, which allows students to build an e-portfolio of their skills, achievements, and experiences. Information on HEAR is provided in the Programme Handbooks, which indicates how students may expect to engage with the HEAR system within the programme. In year one, semester one, students participate in the Scientific Communication & Statistics module which develops a range of study skills in the cohort which are relevant to their programme. At this time students will also be instructed on how to access the HEAR system. In year one, semester two, these will be revisited and reinforced in the Scientific & Laboratory Skills module. Induction in subsequent years: Specific induction sessions are also organised for students in subsequent years. The aim is to ensure that students are aware of the changing academic expectations associated with progression through the programme. In the undergraduate programmes, induction into second year focuses on placement issues, and the increasingly discipline-specific nature of second year. Final year focuses on the Investigative Project and other key final year assessments, and alerts students to the standards pertaining to their final year programme. Attendance monitoring: Should a student record an unacceptable level of attendance or engagement with their studies (typically absence of more than two sessions in a single week), the student, in the first instance, will be forwarded an email message (copied to the Course Director) advising the said student that, if there is a particular significant reason for their reduced attendance/engagement, they should see their Year Tutor in the first instance. If they do not wish to speak with their Studies Adviser it will be expected that they make good their attendance or should a poor record of attendance/ engagement continue they will be called to an interview by the Attendance & Engagement Panel. All students failing to attend classes will be asked to submit an NA1 from the first day of their absence and these are to be copied to the School Office. Should a student speak with their Year Tutor at this stage then the Studies Adviser should complete the appropriate \u2018Record Meeting Form.\u2019 Should a student continue to demonstrate a poor record of attendance and/or engagement without a legitimate explanation the said student will be asked to attend an interview with the Attendance & Engagement Panel. Should a student fail to present themselves for interview he/she will be given one further opportunity to attend for interview. If the student fails to attend on the second occasion he/she will receive a letter indicating that it has been presumed that he/she has withdrawn from the course. The student will be offered the opportunity to complete a withdrawal form or, should there be personal or extenuating circumstances to cover their continued absence, to meet with their Course Director to", "extract": "approved pathology laboratory.

the appropriate \u2018Record Meeting Form.\u2019 Should a student continue to demonstrate a poor record of attendance and/or engagement without a legitimate explanation the said student will be asked to attend an interview with the Attendance & Engagement Panel. Should a student fail to present themselves for interview he/she will be given one further opportunity to attend for interview. If the student fails to attend on the second occasion he/she will receive a letter indicating that it has been presumed that he/she has withdrawn from the course. The student will be offered the opportunity to complete a withdrawal form or, should there be personal or extenuating circumstances to cover their continued absence, to meet with their Course Director to discuss the possibility of applying for a Leave of Absence. Continued absences will result in further interviews by the Attendance & Engagement Panel to include the Head/Associate Head of School. For DL students, the eTutor is required to run Course reports every 2-3 weeks to check on student engagement and contact those students who have low activity levels. Students may also be required to attend an attendance board. Retention: The School has a defined strategy in relation to retention and has put in place a series of initiatives to address retention and transition issues. A School Recruitment and Admissions Sub-Committee addresses the recommendations of the School Recruitment Policy. The Year one attrition rate (2022-2023) for the Biomedical Science programmes resulted in the following: BSc Hons Biomedical Sc. s FT 4.7% 2 (students), BSc Hons Biomed. Sci DPP FT 5.7% (2 students) and BSc Hons Biomed Sc DPP (Pathology) FT 3.7% (1 student). Success rates for the programmes during this reporting period was one of the highest in the University at 87.8%, 96.4% 95.5% respectively. Reasons for early leavers were either due not financial or health related issues. This board seeks to identify the main reason for non-attendance and provides students with support (or identifies where support can be obtained) as necessary. Attendance records are kept for all lectures, practical classes, and seminars, logged, and monitored. The Qwickly tool in BBLearn is now available to aid in electronic monitoring of attendance. Students who are absent are expected to complete a Notification of Absence (NA1) form on-line; if absence is a result of illness, or other personal circumstances students are expected to complete an Extenuating Circumstances (EC1) form. Our monitoring system has been successful in identifying students who have legitimate reasons for poor attendance and who needed further, and in some cases significant, pastoral, and counselling support. There are several modes of support for students on the course. Support Year Tutor: Each student is allocated a member of staff as their Year Tutor. This additional support ensures students have the best possible learning experience, achieve their study goals and progress to graduation in a timely manner by providing expert knowledge, pastoral support, and targeted coaching interventions.\u201d The role of the Student Year Tutor is to: Build a one-to-one relationship Successfully support new student onboarding Provide reactive support Provide proactive support and coaching Actively Re-engage Community Building The Year Tutor who is responsible for a particular year group offers academic guidance and pastoral support to students throughout their university course, meets each student at least once per semester, or more often if appropriate. Students are encouraged to use their Year Tutors as their first point of contact over any concerns they may have, and their Year Tutor will also seek help from the course director or other university support services on the student\u2019s behalf if deemed necessary. Peer Assisted Study Skills (PASS): Peer Assisted Study Skills (PASS) allows higher year students (Year 2 and Final) to undertake a PASS Leader role, normally working in pairs facilitating on campus study sessions (1 hour) for lower year groups on their course. The rationale behind such modules is to facilitate study sessions for groups of lower year students in a non-threatening environment. In doing so, it will allow for the revision of material that students may be finding challenging. Mentors are expected to attend training and complete the associated assessment activities prior to mentoring. The CD oversees and monitors PASS sessions which occur weekly. Studiocity Peer Mentoring: Studiocity Peer Mentoring allows final year students to undertake one to one Peer Mentoring to first year undergraduate students at Course and Module Level. Similar to PASS, one to one support and/or signposting students to relevant help whilst applying the \u2018help not answers\u2019 approach is delivered, however each mentoring session is online, with the expectations of providing approximately 16 hours of one-one mentoring across the academic year. If a mentor request help and a mentee is available in real time they will be connected. If not an app sends a message to all suitable mentors with times the mentee would like help and the first to agree a suitable time to connect with the mentee gets the opportunity. Student-Staff Consultation: The Student-Staff Consultative Committee (SSCC) is chaired by the Course Director and includes another member of staff and student representatives from the programme. The SSCC meets at least once per semester and reports to the Course Committee. Matters raised at SSCC include both academic issues (e.g., module delivery) as well as non-academic issues such as library use and computer services support. The response of the course committee to the external examiners report is discussed in Semester 2 of the academic year. The SSCC for DL students is conducted via telephone conference with the course director and the manager of the eLearning Support Unit. Information arising from the SSCC is presented at the Subject Committee, the School Board and relevant Faculty committees, when appropriate. Student comments are highly valued and acted upon. All actions taken as a result of the Consultative Committees/Student Support are communicated back to all students via the relevant student representatives. Continuing Professional Development (CPD): The University is committed to supporting and developing its staff not only in the early stages of their career but throughout their", "extract": "should complete the appropriate \u2018Record Meeting Form.\u2019 Should a student continue to demonstrate a poor record of attendance and/or engagement without a legitimate explanation the said student will be asked to attend an interview with the Attendance & Engagement Panel.

The response of the course committee to the external examiners report is discussed in Semester 2 of the academic year. The SSCC for DL students is conducted via telephone conference with the course director and the manager of the eLearning Support Unit. Information arising from the SSCC is presented at the Subject Committee, the School Board and relevant Faculty committees, when appropriate. Student comments are highly valued and acted upon. All actions taken as a result of the Consultative Committees/Student Support are communicated back to all students via the relevant student representatives. Continuing Professional Development (CPD): The University is committed to supporting and developing its staff not only in the early stages of their career but throughout their employment. It is believed that such ongoing Continuing Professional Development (CPD) will also contribute to an increase in, or the maintenance of knowledge, skills and personal qualities for effective learning and teaching delivery to our students. The School is committed to providing developmental appraisal reviews (DAR) for staff who are not in probation or part of the professoriate (they have their own processes) to support staff in their ongoing professional development. Student Wellbeing Support: Here at UU we want to help our students as much as possible. Many support facilities are available to students, coming in the form of The Students Union, The Chaplaincy, Careers Service and Student Services. Student Services offer support to students in the areas of accommodation, community liaison, health, counselling, childcare services, disability support and financial issues. Workshops and support classes are also offered to encourage and help students who may have issues with examinations, stress, learning, study and lifestyle organization and disabilities such as dyslexia. Details of these workshops and classes are advertised to all students. Our Student Wellbeing team provide a range of services to help our students in their time of need which include: Mental Health and Wellbeing https://www.ulster.ac.uk/wellbeing/health-and-wellbeing Counselling https://www.ulster.ac.uk/wellbeing/health-and-wellbeing/counselling Disability https://www.ulster.ac.uk/wellbeing/disability Sexual Health Clinic https://www.ulster.ac.uk/wellbeing/sexual-health Mind Your Mood https://www.ulster.ac.uk/wellbeing/support-programmes/mind-your-mood Chaplaincy https://www.ulster.ac.uk/wellbeing/chaplaincy Financial https://www.ulster.ac.uk/student/fees/hardship-fund Access Ability Advisors within Student Wellbeing provide a range of services and resources to help all Ulster University students with disabilities. Students can disclose their disability on their UCAS application form prior to entry, upon their direct entry application to UU, or directly through the link via the student portal https://www.ulster.ac.uk/wellbeing. The team assesses each student in order to determine what support they need to provide, which can include exam adjustments or assistance with note taking. Ongoing advice is also provided to our staff on reasonable adjustments for students, thus ensures that students with a disability are able to get the same university experience as their peers. Our aim is to offer students with disabilities early access to key services and to provide students with disabilities such as autism tours so that they can become familiar and comfortable with their new environment, enable them to address their fear of the unknown and provide them with one-to-one knowledge of what they can expect at university.

With our newly appointed Dean of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, UU is committed to providing equality of opportunity for our staff and students, creating an environment which places diversity and inclusion at the heart of our culture. The University summarises how it proposes to fulfil the duties in relation to equality within our programmes https://www.ulster.ac.uk/peopleandculture/employee-benefits/equality- diversity/equality-policies-and-guidance. UU is part of a five-year action plan (2022 \u2013 2027) to promoting positive attitudes towards people with disabilities with the aim of becoming increasingly proactive in promoting and celebrating difference within our Biomedical Science profession. The IBMS Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Working Group was set up in 2022 to help create an inclusive team-working ethos and to share ideas through their social media channels and the Biomedical Scientist monthly gazette. UU will utilise such resources within the teaching of the 'Professional Practice' modules BMS307 and BMS309. The year 2 BMS321 pathology placement preparation module also participates in EDI focused lectures and workshops along with healthcare employer engagement. During such placement preparation sessions, and as part of the IBMS registration portfolio, students will be taught equality legislation and how to apply it to their practice. B1.4 Information Literacy and Digital Capabilities Digital Futures Strategy (2020-2023) describes how Information Services will provide technical, digital, information and application strategies to underpin the operational running of the University, whilst enabling transformation and growth. It recognises the fundamental change brought about by Covid-19 and the need to develop solutions to support greater mobility in a secure, sustainable, and agile manner, including the greater use of cloud and managed services, remote solutions and standardised platforms. The strategy builds upon principles and ambitions based upon \u2018empowering people through digital,\u2019 and provides staff and students access to enabling technologies and digital services across a range of foundation infrastructure and end user platforms, both in a localised, cloud, and mobile manner. Access, Digital and Distributed Learning (ADDL) hosts the University\u2019s Virtual Learning Environment (BB Learn) and supports campus, blended and distance learning students in partnership with Faculties and Departments of the University. ADDL also provides a suite of tools, technologies and services to support and enhance learning and teaching across the University. Blackboard Learn support is available from ADDL via the support wiki, Blackboard Learn Helpdesk and online induction resources. Every student now receives a free download of Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus for the duration of their studies. This provides a digital platform which allows students to manage their work electronically with cloud-based storage, automatic backup", "extract": "services support.

infrastructure and end user platforms, both in a localised, cloud, and mobile manner. Access, Digital and Distributed Learning (ADDL) hosts the University\u2019s Virtual Learning Environment (BB Learn) and supports campus, blended and distance learning students in partnership with Faculties and Departments of the University. ADDL also provides a suite of tools, technologies and services to support and enhance learning and teaching across the University. Blackboard Learn support is available from ADDL via the support wiki, Blackboard Learn Helpdesk and online induction resources. Every student now receives a free download of Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus for the duration of their studies. This provides a digital platform which allows students to manage their work electronically with cloud-based storage, automatic backup and specific training resources available. Staff undergo mandatory training with the Office of Digital Learning to keep abreast of new developments and tools which can be incorporated into teaching. Online assessment and feedback are already widely used at UU with approximately 100,000 electronic submissions per academic year. The electronic management of assessment further streamlines the assessment cycle for students, academic staff and administrators in terms of efficiency and allows for rich feedback and direct engagement with the students, providing timely, clear and meaningful feedback to students in a consistent manner is key to helping students progress through their studies. UU\u2019s Principles of Assessment and Feedback for Learning (refer to Section B1.6 Assessment Strategies). The courses described in this document will adhere to the three core elements of electronic management of assessment that include: Online submission of written assignments: the process whereby a student submits work online for storage and retrieval for marking, feedback and review. This can include originality checking. Online return of marks: the process whereby academic and teaching staff provide online marks to students. Online return of marks and feedback: the process whereby students access and view their marks and feedback online. There are practical reasons why online submission of all written assessments may not be suitable and exceptions will be permitted, for example, submission of subject specific file types. For agreed exception, alternative arrangements can be made for submission. In these instances academic teams should use the Grade Centre within Blackboard to return student marks and any feedback. Clear instructions on assignments will be provided in all modules within BB Learn, with further guidance, exemplars, troubleshooting advice and contacts provided to assist students. The adoption of this approach reinforces Digital Fluency for students, one of the key student learning principles that we have embedded throughout our programmes. It is now becoming apparent that Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools will be part of our personal and professional lives, however with the concern of plagiarism amongst students, UU will ensure that AI tools are used in ethical, transparent, and reasonable ways. At a course level, AI tools may be used by module coordinators, when, as well as students, they too can learn about new concepts and further develop digital skills in the process, however they should consider the extent to which AI is incorporated into their teaching and assessment strategies. Where generative AI tools have been used for an assessment, they must be acknowledged appropriately to ensure that any output is not misconstrued as the student\u2019s own work. Additionally, before beginning any piece of assessed work, module coordinators should inform students if the use of AI tools is authorised, as this practice may differ across modules and courses of study. When submitting coursework students will be required to sign an AI declaration, which will appear on the coursework submission sheet: B1.5 Learning and Teaching Strategy Our curricula have been developed with consideration of Barnett and Coates\u2019 dimensions of knowing, doing, and being (Barnett and Coate, 2005) and are guided by Ulster\u2019s Integrated Curriculum Design Framework. The University Learning and Teaching Strategy (2018/19-2023/24) has three strategic aims: To provide appropriate learning opportunities which are flexible, responsive to, and inclusive of, the needs of students, professions, industry, and the wider community; to provide transformative, high quality, learning experiences through the promotion of meaningful staff student partnerships that engender a shared responsibility and to enhance Ulster\u2019s role as a sector leader for student employability as an integral part of the wider student experience. In addition to these aims, the programmes also adhere to Ulster\u2019s Student Learning Experience Principles: Ulster Learning Model Digital Fluency Employability Ethics & Sustainability Internationalization Research Teaching Nexus Though adoption of these aims and principles, there is an increased expectation that the Faculty will retain a greater proportion of its students and will contribute to the recruitment of students from underrepresented and lower socio-economic groups. Thus, the Course Team is aware of the need in its teaching and learning to: Respect diverse talents and ways of learning; Encourage contact between students and staff; Develop cooperation among students; and Use active learning techniques. In line with the Faculty\u2019s current Teaching and Learning Strategy, the Course Team is committed in its approach to assessments by: Using a variety of assessment procedures; Communicating high expectations; Emphasising time on task; Providing prompt effective feedback. The learning experience provided will encourage students to become active and motivated learners, who can seek information, question and analyse its validity and draw appropriate and logical conclusions. The main aim is to ensure students acquire core skills and subject knowledge in the biomedical sciences and provide the opportunity for reflection and evaluation of current practice and policy, enabling lifelong learning and professional development in biomedical sciences. We will encourage critical thinking, and creative and strategic problem-solving skills. This is in line with the University\u2019s strategic Learning and Teaching aims. All students will be provided with a Course Handbook which contains details of the organisation of teaching and learning, and the programme-wide arrangements for submission of work and return of assessed material, as well as specific details regarding the expectations of the programme team. Individual modules will also be supported by on-line module information, which will contain all relevant details regarding module content, and a schedule of events, information on", "extract": "of foundation infrastructure and end user platforms, both in a localised, cloud, and mobile manner.

policy, enabling lifelong learning and professional development in biomedical sciences. We will encourage critical thinking, and creative and strategic problem-solving skills. This is in line with the University\u2019s strategic Learning and Teaching aims. All students will be provided with a Course Handbook which contains details of the organisation of teaching and learning, and the programme-wide arrangements for submission of work and return of assessed material, as well as specific details regarding the expectations of the programme team. Individual modules will also be supported by on-line module information, which will contain all relevant details regarding module content, and a schedule of events, information on assessment, including marking schemes, and any other relevant information. Programmes in the School are managed and supported by a core team including the Course Director, Module Co-ordinator, Placement Tutor (where appropriate), eTutors (where appropriate). Modules have been designed in line with Ulster\u2019s Module Design Parameters to promote the wellbeing of both staff and students. While 20 credit point modules are used wherever possible, some 10 credit point modules remain in our programmes to meet the requirements of our PSRBs and to avoid timetable clashes with other courses within the School. Learning and Teaching Methods: Students are exposed to a wide variety of teaching and assessment approaches that provide a stimulating, engaging environment for learning, as well as catering for the different aptitudes and preferences exhibited by the student body. These approaches are designed to ensure the transition from secondary education to higher education is manageable for students as they adapt to new teaching methods. Listed below are some key examples of the teaching offered on our courses with rationale for each provided. Formal lectures remain a key feature in teaching and learning, providing direct contact time for students. However, lectures are increasingly interactive, and may include discussion elements. A high proportion of lectures are delivered using PowerPoint presentations and this teaching material is adapted for presentation on BBLearn. The interactive nature of face- to-face teaching is mirrored in the eLearning environment by discussion boards, asynchronous chat rooms and immersive virtual worlds. Some tutors also provide hard copy lecture notes that students can purchase through the Faculty laboratories. Video clips, audio clips, online quizzes, apps and other up-to-date visual aids are also used to support lectures. The School monitors attendance at all timetabled face-to-face teaching activities and a similar approach is used in the online environment to ensure all students are engaging with the material and to quickly pick up those who may be struggling with some concepts so that tutorial support and peer support may be provided. Practical classes are fundamental to the study of science and may take the form of laboratory classes, for example, first year physiology, biochemistry and chemistry where core laboratory skills are acquired. The more discipline specific laboratory skills and use of more complex laboratory equipment are delivered during second year practical classes and while on placement, where applicable. Academic staff are supported by post-graduate student Demonstrators who provide practical help, advice on experimental procedure and ensure that correct Health and Safety Procedures are followed. A training course for Demonstrators is provided. Practical classes are also supported by the use of computers/mobile devices where students use Computer Aided Learning (CAL) packages to experiment in the virtual environment. Computer practical classes are used to teach the theory and application of statistics. Case studies and evidence-based practice (EBP) are used to illustrate the practical application of subject specific knowledge using the latest research- and practice informed scientific knowledge. Evidence and testimonies from service users is presented to demonstrate theory-to-practice, thereby making students more aware of real-life applications. These learning approaches can also be used in assessment with students asked to select and apply knowledge and illustrate practical aspects of real-life scenarios thereby enhancing core skills. Seminar work is designed not only to extend the lecture topics but also equip students with the skills to seek out relevant subject material and to present and defend the material within a given timeframe. With the increasing amount of information available on the web, the knowledge and skills to select appropriate, scientifically sound material, is vital to equip students for continuing personal, professional and intellectual development throughout their careers. DL students may be expected to develop a presentation with embedded narration or deliver their seminar within the virtual world. During placement year students have the opportunity to present to placement providers and in final year students present to their peers and academic members of staff. Tutorials are used to support students who need help with their studies in specific subject areas. Increasingly BBLearn is the environment of choice for delivery of certain tutorial aspects irrespective of whether the student is on-campus or DL mode. Blackboard Learn (BBLearn): All of the modules provided by distance learning are delivered via BBLearn, the online teaching tool for the University. BBLearn is also used to supplement campus-based programmes, where it provides an alternative and stimulating learning environment. eLearning at Ulster includes personalised online access to course material, university library systems, academic and student support programs, and electronic communication tools. ELearning is therefore fully blended into the traditional delivery of on campus material. Training in BBLearn is readily available to teaching staff via the University\u2019s Staff Development section. All students are informed about the availability of, and have access to, the set of on-line tutorials regarding general and specific use of BBLearn. Students are also provided with personal support from technical and academic staff if required. The performance dashboard on BBL allows the e-tutor and module co-ordinator to monitor the activity of students on each module to assess their level of engagement with the module content. In this way students who may be struggling with some concepts may be quickly identified and so that tutorial support and peer support may be provided.

Development section. All students are informed about the availability of, and have access to, the set of on-line tutorials regarding general and specific use of BBLearn. Students are also provided with personal support from technical and academic staff if required. The performance dashboard on BBL allows the e-tutor and module co-ordinator to monitor the activity of students on each module to assess their level of engagement with the module content. In this way students who may be struggling with some concepts may be quickly identified and so that tutorial support and peer support may be provided. Group working is an important element of learning in the School. It is used to help students acquire, integrate and apply knowledge from a variety of sources, solve problems, engage with case studies, and prepare for and present seminar work. The DL mode allows for relevant group interaction via Discussion Board and Chat tools, and increasingly via the virtual world. These tools facilitate monitoring by academic staff by reviewing log-in and postings for all group members. In a module which contributes to an award classification and where group work is a component of assessment, normally at least 25% of each student\u2019s assessment result in the group work shall be based on his or her individual contribution. Problem-based learning is being increasingly used to provide student-centred learning. Active learning takes place in small groups, with the responsibility placed upon the student to identify and acquire the resources required to construct or investigate a problem. Assignments are an essential part of teaching and learning as they encourage students to be independent learners. Assignments take a variety of forms are used to encourage students to read the literature underpinning lectures, integrate and apply knowledge and improve written skills. Assignments can include MCQs, structured essays, literature reviews, case studies, word limited reports, data analysis, and presentations. Projects are undertaken by all final year undergraduate and MBiomedSci students. Students will be supervised by allocated academics, within one of the research groups within the School of Biomedical Sciences. All attempts will be made to accommodate student preference; however the nature of the projects on offer will depend on the current research interests of academic staff. The Ulster University\u2019s Biomedical Sciences Ethics filter committee will ensure that appropriate ethical approval is in place and that the project complies with Research Governance procedures and policy of the University. For a list of research project titles on offer to students see Appendix 8. Interprofessional education and learning is an important aspect of development of student\u2019s wider appreciation of the multi-disciplinary nature of teams providing healthcare delivery. The School places particular importance on inter-disciplinary team working through learning about profession specific roles and identities emphasizing how professions interact in the workplace. This is reinforced by masterclasses, the professional skills module, professional practice modules and placement, plus the use of guest speakers, and coupled with assignments reinforcing interprofessionalism within the Biomedical Science profession. IPE has been previously discussed at the end of Section A. Critical thinking Skills are fundamental to the development of academic and professional skills in our students. The courses are designed to educate students about scientific writing, integrity and communication, and the opportunity to build these skill sets is embedded throughout the various activities and assessments across each study year. This empowers students to build the critical thinking skills which can particularly be applied to the final year research project. As part of this process, they will be educated on developing writing and referencing skills in order to evidence their academic skills. This is an integral part of assessment in various modules and is supported by bespoke learning resources from the library, including the Faculty of Life & Health Sciences Referencing Guidelines document (http://guides.library.ulster.ac.uk/ld.php?content_id=31342059). Several members of the School of Biomedical Sciences contributed to the development of this resources which is provided to all students studying these programmes. B1.6 Assessment Strategy The varied assessment methods involving both coursework and examinations in our programmes adhere to the principles of inclusive assessment and PSRB requirements. Indeed the IBMS guidelines encourage examination assessment. Employing multiple types of assessments however ensures that no specific student group is disadvantaged by any single assessment format. Moreover, this diversity in assessment activities fosters the development of a wider range of personal and employability skills (Brown and Glasner, 2003). The programmes have been designed taking cognisance of the Learning and Teaching Strategies developed by the University, Faculty and the School of Biomedical Sciences. All assessment in our programmes is in accordance with the latest version of the University Assessment Handbook (Sept 2021) (https://www.ulster.ac.uk/ data/assets/pdf_file/0006/306906/AssessmentHandbook.pdf). UU have also considered feedback from students, external examiners, placement providers and employers in the selection and (re-) design of our assessment across the programme. This has resulted in a more streamlined assessment process, including reduction of assessment in modules where appropriate, as well as timely scheduling of deadlines. The adoption of assessment rubrics is included within each module handbook, and exemplars of such rubrics are provided in the document. Students will be encouraged to engage with and use rubrics feedback to feed-forward into future assessments, and to carry feedback into new modules as they move through the programme. In particular, Ulster\u2019s Principles of Assessment and Feedback for Learning are used to inform design of assessment and learning in our programmes. These state that assessment and feedback for learning should: Help to clarify, from the early stages of a programme, what good performance means (goals, criteria, standards). Encourage \u2018time and effort\u2019 on challenging learning tasks which recognise the importance of learning from the tasks, not just demonstrating learning through the tasks. Deliver timely learner-related feedback information that helps students to self- correct and communicate clear, high expectations and professionalism. Provide opportunities for students to act on feedback and close any gap between current and desired performance through complementary and integrated curriculum design and pedagogic practice.

"title": "Section 19", "text": "Feedback for Learning are used to inform design of assessment and learning in our programmes. These state that assessment and feedback for learning should: Help to clarify, from the early stages of a programme, what good performance means (goals, criteria, standards). Encourage \u2018time and effort\u2019 on challenging learning tasks which recognise the importance of learning from the tasks, not just demonstrating learning through the tasks. Deliver timely learner-related feedback information that helps students to self- correct and communicate clear, high expectations and professionalism. Provide opportunities for students to act on feedback and close any gap between current and desired performance through complementary and integrated curriculum design and pedagogic practice. Ensure that all assessment has a beneficial, constructive impact on student learning, encouraging positive motivational beliefs, confidence, and self-esteem. Facilitate the development of self- and peer-assessment skills and reflection on learning, to enable students to progressively take more responsibility for their own learning, and to inspire a lifelong capacity to learn. Encourage interaction and dialogue around learning and professional practice including supporting the development of student learning groups and peer learning communities. Available at: https://www.ulster.ac.uk/cherp/resources/assessment-and-feedback We also consider feedback from students via our module feedback and NSSs, external examiners, placement providers and employers in the selection and (re-) design of our assessment across the programmes. This has resulted in a more streamlined assessment process, including reduction of assessment in modules where appropriate, as well as timely scheduling of deadlines. The adoption of assessment rubrics is encouraged, and exemplars of rubrics are provided in the document Appendices. Student feedback from yearly National Students Survey\u2019s (NSS\u2019s) suggests that the additional support has made a real impact and has increased confidence, this empowers our students to enjoy the full higher education experience. UU is also proud that our student wellbeing team have recently been awarded with an Autism Award from \u2018Autism NI\u2019 in recognition of our student wellbeing team\u2019s work supporting students with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). The course team, in revising the programme, has sought to address these 7 principles by reviewing the type, frequency and timing of assessments. To clarify expectations, students are provided with module handbooks (Appendix 16 Module Handbook exemplars) at the beginning of the module, and these contain comprehensive information regarding module content, learning outcomes, assessment requirements, criteria, and marking schemes. In preparation for examinations, module coordinators will usually offer bespoke tutorials providing advice on exam technique, using past papers and exemplar answers to demonstrate to students what is expected. Rubrics used for marking are typically available to students before assignments are submitted. The various tables shown in Figure B6-9 illustrate the separate teaching period structure for each module and the scheduling of each assignment within that time. In line with the University\u2019s support for students with special educational needs, reasonable adjustments will be made to assessments to accommodate the needs of students in accordance with the Special Education Needs and Disability (NI) Order 2005 (SENDO). Reasonable adjustments recommendations can include the following types of support: Teaching and learning support Exam and assessment support Library support Access considerations and physical adaptations Support providers/additional study support Assistive technology Although we do not provide any personal care support through our Register of Support Providers, we can work with social care teams to help facilitate student needs and requirements through external agencies. Assessment Type & Schedule In accordance with the new Curriculum Design Principles and the Assessment Handbook, each 20-credit module will have 40-hour notional assessment work hours (10 credit module = 20 assessment hours). All modules will have two items of assessment (e.g. exam and coursework). However an item of assessment (typically the coursework item) may be broken down into a number of smaller staged/cumulative tasks (deliverables), as advised in the Assessment handbook. Assessment may consist exclusively of coursework submission (defined as any non-examination-based assessment), or coursework in combination with sessional examination. Coursework assessment methods within each module vary, giving students a broad range of opportunities to develop their assessment skills, outside the traditional written and timed examination route. As a result, the majority of modules described in this document have adopted a patchwork test mod, whereby one item of assessment (e.g. practical assessment) is broken down into smaller staged/cumulative tasks which stitch together into a portfolio of coursework assessment which measures the required outcomes. Examples of this type of approach can be viewed for various modules in Tables B6 to B9 and (Appendix 16 Module Handbook exemplars). Coursework assessments are designed to test both knowledge and skills, and include practical skills assessment, presentations, critical review, report writing, problem-based learning, multiple choice tests and group-work assignments. The patchwork test approach is ideal for our courses since practical classes are such an integral part of our modules, it allows students to develop and reinforce practical skillsets in stepwise fashion, as well as improving crucial scientific skills, such as critical enquiry, presentation, science writing and integrity. This cumulative approach has been well- received by students, as it allows them continuous opportunity to self- and peer-review as they progress, as well as improving engagement and attendance. Many of the tasks are also completed within class-time, ensuring assessment does not unnecessarily intrude on free-time of students. They also encompass a number of innovative pedagogic approaches to assessment, particularly in the use of technology (e.g. Peerwise and BBLearn tools) to deliver the tasks. This diversity of assessment within our programmes reflects the course team\u2019s awareness of the kind of knowledge and skills needed in students and graduates. This is also in line with the University\u2019s assessment strategy which recommends a range of processes through which students can demonstrate their learning outcomes. Assessment design is also continually informed by recommendations from placement providers, as well as prospective employers in the Bioscience industry and beyond, about the skillsets students require for employability. To clarify expectations, students are provided with module handbooks (Table B6 Module Handbook exemplars) at the beginning of the module, and these contain comprehensive information regarding module content, learning outcomes, assessment requirements, criteria and marking schemes.", "extract": "Feedback for Learning are used to inform design of assessment and learning in our programmes.

This diversity of assessment within our programmes reflects the course team\u2019s awareness of the kind of knowledge and skills needed in students and graduates. This is also in line with the University\u2019s assessment strategy which recommends a range of processes through which students can demonstrate their learning outcomes. Assessment design is also continually informed by recommendations from placement providers, as well as prospective employers in the Bioscience industry and beyond, about the skillsets students require for employability. To clarify expectations, students are provided with module handbooks (Table B6 Module Handbook exemplars) at the beginning of the module, and these contain comprehensive information regarding module content, learning outcomes, assessment requirements, criteria and marking schemes. The module handbooks and course handbook are also within the Course support area. This is a central area in BBL where all students can access general information and communicate with one another. The assessments aim to promote independence of learning and encourage students to apply their experience and expertise. In preparation for examinations, module coordinators will usually offer bespoke tutorials providing advice on exam technique, using past papers and exemplar answers to demonstrate to students what is expected. Where possible, module co-ordinators will make every effort to ensure that summative assessment deadlines are spread over the semester (Tables B6 to B9). Some aspects of coursework occur across the semester whereas other pieces of coursework will naturally fall towards the end of the module. Students will be given prompt feedback, and the focus in the early parts of the modules will provide formative feedback to help future assessments. Students will be given details of all pieces of assessment at the beginning of the module and encouraged to manage their schedule of assessments. Submission of student work: The School of Biomedical Sciences has a number of policies associated with the submission and marking of student work which will be adhered to for these programmes. As outlined above, electronic management of assessment is being adopted across all our courses. This will ensure that assessment arrangements meet the terms set out by Ulster\u2019s Quality Precepts for Digital Learning, particularly in relation to security, safe receipt and confidence in student identity. Where possible, coursework will be submitted via Blackboard Learn either to Turnitin or/and assignment drop box. For agreed exceptions, alternative arrangements can be made for submission. Students submitting work must complete an assessment cover sheet which includes a declaration of originality pertaining to their work. For all students (on campus and DL), late submission of coursework will result in the assignment not being marked. Any requests for extensions of the deadline for the hand in of an assignment should be submitted with an Extenuating Circumstances (EC1) form. EC1 forms are only accepted if supported by appropriate documented evidence and are reviewed by the course director in line with UU Absence and extenuating Circumstances policy https://www.ulster.ac.uk/student/exams/extenuating-circumstances. Marking of student work The module co-ordinator or e-tutor will mark assessments. Marks are collated, checked and moderated by the module coordinator who returns these electronically, with comments and feedback to the students. All assignments are marked against a marking scheme. Assessment criteria have used University\u2019s generic level criteria as a template to develop subject-specific criteria for marking. All distinction, border line or fail level assignments and a random selection of assignments are internally moderated. All presentations are assessed by a minimum of two academic staff members who use a marking scheme to assess content, presentation skills, understanding, and the ability to answer questions, reaching consensus on the final mark. Written feedback is provided to the students. All projects are double marked, and an average of the two marks is given. Where there is a significant difference in the marks awarded, the two examiners will resolve this by discussion. In the absence of an agreement being reached, a third marker will assess the project. Examination scripts are anonymously marked against a marking scheme and a sample internally moderated with all failed pieces of assessment and all those given a first-class mark scrutinised. Students may be penalised for not meeting or exceeding assignment word counts when one is specified. The University have recently introduced a policy on word limits and penalties for exceeding the word limit will be applied consistently in line with the policy as follows: +10% no penalty +>10-20% 5% penalty +>20-30% 10% penalty +>30-40% 15% penalty +>40-50% 20% penalty +>50% maximum mark of 40% UG/50% PG Such penalties are clearly articulated at the start of each module. For most students with disability, learning outcomes are equally achievable with only minor adjustments to assessment methods. For some specific cases, more specialised assessment arrangements can be adopted to suit individual circumstances, provided that the learning outcomes are still being met.

Assessment & feedback for learning should: Clarify good performance Encourage time and effort on task Deliver timely high-quality feedback Provide opportunities to act on feedback Encourage positive motivational beliefs Develop self-assessment and reflection Encourage interaction and dialogue The above principles have been endorsed by the Students Union. Students will receive marks and feedback on their work/performance which is normally returned within 20 working-days of submission. All coursework is returned with written advice/annotated marks which includes both written and verbal comments and can be provided on both an individual and/or group basis. Students are therefore encouraged to pay attention to not only the written feedback on assignments, but also the oral feedback and comments they are receiving in and out of class. Feedback may be delivered in differing forms including: Tips on how to best approach assignments and examinations to maximize student learning and performance. General and specific comments and help made in lectures/tutorials/seminars/practical classes about their work, progress by lecturers and/or demonstrators. Specific written comments on their work to help indicate progress and develop their understanding. Students can discuss individual assessment marks and comments with module Co- ordinators and relevant teaching staff. Students may appeal academic decisions in accordance with the University appeals policy, available at http://www.ulster.ac.uk/guide/proceduresregulations/assessmentexams/appeals-against- academic-decisions/ Plagiarism and Contact Cheating The course team is aware of the increased ease by which students can access material through the internet. In submission guidelines, students are educated about plagiarism, using various examples to illustrate obvious and not-so-obvious examples of plagiarism. For assignment submission, where appropriate, the internet-based technology, Turnitin is used as a mechanism to check for instances of plagiarism from both academic and non-academic sources. If submitted work is discovered to be plagiarised, or where there appears to be collusion between two or more students for a piece of coursework, the course team will follow University procedures as outlined at Faculty level. The School plagiarism officer will meet with offending students if necessary to provide further education on how to avoid plagiarism. Further details on the University\u2019s policy and procedures on plagiarism, and guidance are offered to the students on this matter can be found not only within their course handbook but also at https://www.ulster.ac.uk/student/exams/cheating-and-plagiarism The University\u2019s definition of plagiarism makes explicit that copying from texts or web or other sources and coping work from other students constitutes plagiarism. Students are made aware of this in the University Student Handbook which states: \u201cPlagiarism is the act of taking or copying someone else\u2019s work, including another student, and presenting it as if it were one\u2019s own. Plagiarism is said to occur when ideas, texts, theories, data, created artistic artefacts or other material are presented without acknowledgement so that the person considering this work is given the impression that what they have before them is the student\u2019s own original work when it is not. Plagiarism also occurs where a student\u2019s own work is re-presented without being properly referenced. Plagiarism is a form of cheating and is a disciplinary offence.\u201d Guidelines to students include: Students are expected to adopt good academic practice in referencing their materials and sources throughout their programme. The plagiarism policy and penalties for plagiarism offence are highlighted at induction and regularly throughout the programme. Additional advice is also issued to students in their programme Handbook and the course support area of BBL has specific information and a plagiarism quiz to help students understand plagiarism. Staff are encouraged to vary module assignment topics from year to year so work cannot be copied from one year to the next. The standard coursework submission sheet for the receipting of coursework includes an explicit reference to the University\u2019s definition of plagiarism as follows: \u201cI declare that this is my own work and that any material I have referred to has been accurately and consistently referenced. I have read the University\u2019s policy on plagiarism and understand the definition of plagiarism as given in the [course/subject] handbook. If it is shown that material has been plagiarised, or I have otherwise attempted to obtain an unfair advantage for myself or others, I understand that I may face sanctions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the University. A mark of zero may be awarded and the reason for that mark will be recorded on my file.\u201d Across the University, the issues of plagiarism and contract cheating are considered regularly at various Teaching & Learning meetings, with guidance and advice for students and staff updated where appropriate. Several of the course team attend such meetings at School and Faculty level and are therefore well-placed to embed any new guidance into the course in a timely fashion.

Staff are more aware than ever of the importance to support students as they strive towards professional careers. To assist with this, a number of coordinated employability events continue to be integrated within the curriculum. Ulster has launched an Employability Portal https://employability.ulster.ac.uk/ which provides a personalised interface for every student to collect their skills, experience and reflections in support of their journey to employability. For Biomedical Sciences students, bespoke events organised in conjunction with the Careers Development Centre are arranged to provide constructive advice about opportunities, placements, jobs and how to secure such positions. The speakers highlight key skills and requisites that graduates require in order to meet the expectations of employers.

Principles. Staff are more aware than ever of the importance to support students as they strive towards professional careers. To assist with this, a number of coordinated employability events continue to be integrated within the curriculum. Ulster has launched an Employability Portal https://employability.ulster.ac.uk/ which provides a personalised interface for every student to collect their skills, experience and reflections in support of their journey to employability. For Biomedical Sciences students, bespoke events organised in conjunction with the Careers Development Centre are arranged to provide constructive advice about opportunities, placements, jobs and how to secure such positions. The speakers highlight key skills and requisites that graduates require in order to meet the expectations of employers. Focused workshops have been held for students to help them get the edge at completing applications and undertaking interviews that will empower them when applying for future career opportunities and graduate programmes. More information is provided in Page 36 Employability. Work-based Learning Work-based learning is an essential element for several of our programmes and provides the focus for integration of theoretical and practical elements through the development of diagnostic / research skills in a supervised professional environment. The work-based learning experience provides opportunities for students to: Apply academic learning to real life situations Work independently and take responsibility Work with others and develop group working and team building skills Develop personally, mature and meet intellectual challenges Develop self-reliance, adaptability and flexibility Clarify their future career pathways Develop their oral and written communication skills Establish good working relationships with people at all levels in an organization Appreciate the organisation and management of companies, institutions and other organisations Develop self-organisational and management skills to plan and use their own time effectively and that of others. The organisation and management of work-based learning (placements) is guided the student fitness to practice approach (available at file:///C:/Users/e10075063/Downloads/1goodprofessional-practice-and-conduct-in- biomedical-science-2023%20(4).pdf). Where students are in placement, or studying DL courses whilst in employment, a close working relationship exists between UU academic staff (placement coordinator) and work-based supervisors of each student. For undergraduate courses, these relationships are maintained primarily through placement tutor activities, who coordinate student mentors/trainers, with support from Course Directors. For DL courses, the eLSU maintain regular communication with nominated guarantors in a student\u2019s workplace, while continuous e-tutor support is also available. The various levels of support therefore provide a robust and rewarding teaching and learning experience for students as they balance academic study with work experience. This is especially important for students who may experience difficulties on placement, which can occur for a variety of reasons, such as illness, disability and personal circumstances. These cases are typically picked up quickly because of the regular monitoring that is in place across the programmes, meaning help, support and reasonable adjustments can be made where necessary. The course team also works closely with UU Student Support unit and will refer students if necessary for extra support and pastoral care. BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology): During the third year of the Applied Biomedical Science programme, students are given the opportunity to learn and develop new knowledge and skills within IBMS approved training laboratories. This placement year aims to develop competencies in all aspects of Biomedical Science professional practice. During and after their placement, students are required to reflect on their placement experience and on the knowledge and skills learned. Thus, students undertake a 48-week placement commencing on 01 September after Year 2 examinations and finishing on 31 August the following year. Throughout the placement year, students experience \u201cone-to-one\u201d working and learning at the bench in a range (minimum of 3 disciplines) of multidisciplinary laboratories (e.g. clinical chemistry, cytology, haematology, immunology, medical microbiology, transfusion science and virology). This is further enhanced through the use of tutorials, case studies, attendance at laboratory meetings and invited lecture series. Testimonies from service users help support the learning. In addition, students will engage in independent learning through researching specific case studies and scenarios and obtaining appropriate evidence for inclusion in the IBMS Registration Training Portfolio for the IBMS Certificate of Competence. Full details of BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science (DPP Pathology) integrated clinical placement is provided in the Placement Handbook provided to students as part of Placement Preparation in Year 2. This handbook contains specific information on: Introduction to practice-based learning and placement Purpose and advantages of placement Role of HCPC, IBMS and ACSLM Roles and responsibilities of parties involved in placement Aims and learning outcomes Organisation, approval, and management of placements Placement process Pre-placement preparation Student supervision Assessment strategy Allocation of placements Monitoring of placement and student progress IBMS Registration Training Portfolio Code of practice and conduct Reflection on placement Quality assurance; and Training for mentors and lab-based supervisors. Further information in relation to placement (e.g. list of training sites, list of qualified mentors and verifiers, Training provided) can be found in Appendix 7. BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DPP/DIAS): Placements are a compulsory part of the four-year undergraduate BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DPP/DIAS) degree programme. Students undertake placement in Year 3 leading to the award of either a Diploma in Professional Practice (DPP) or a Diploma in International Academic Studies (DIAS). The DPP placement is a 48-week placement undertaken in Year 3 either in: Recognised research institutes or universities either in the UK, Republic of Ireland, other European countries, or overseas countries under the supervision of experienced biomedical researchers; or Pharmaceutical industry, research and development, or in quality assurance. Placements may be paid or unpaid and the precise nature of the placement is negotiated between the student, the Placement Tutor and the Placement Provider. The responsibility for obtaining a placement rest with the student although considerable help and guidance are given by the Placement Tutor. Final approval for a placement rest with the Placement Tutor. Students are guided to placements through existing School contacts with companies, and academic and research institutions. In order to proceed to placement, students should be in good academic standing (i.e. have passed all Year 1 and Year 2 module assessments).", "extract": "and Ulster\u2019s Student Learning Principles.

The responsibility for obtaining a placement rest with the student although considerable help and guidance are given by the Placement Tutor. Final approval for a placement rest with the Placement Tutor. Students are guided to placements through existing School contacts with companies, and academic and research institutions. In order to proceed to placement, students should be in good academic standing (i.e. have passed all Year 1 and Year 2 module assessments). For the award of Diploma in International Academic Studies (DIAS), students undertake a study programme at a university abroad, in accordance with Ulster\u2019s Study Abroad policy [available at https://www.ulster.ac.uk/ data/assets/word_doc/0007/251377/SAPolicy.doc ]. Placements may be undertaken in: US under the NI Business Enterprise Initiative (BEI) where students spend one year at an American university undertaking business and marketing units and, if practicable, biomedical science units Exchange programmes between Ulster and other universities in US, Canada, and Australia where students spend one academic year at the exchange university taking appropriate units of study; or Europe under the EU SOCRATES programme designed to encourage inter-university cooperation. The BEI is offered by the Department of Education and Learning to attract students from Northern Ireland into the field of business. The scheme funds the placement year at a university/college within the USA. Students are selected through a series of interviews. Those participating in the scheme are required to be in good academic standing. In the USA students complete work as specified by the host institution. Several students on the BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science course have undertaken BEI funded American university placements over the last few years. Full details of the BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DPP/DIAS) placement are provided in the DPP/DIAS Placement Handbook provided to Year 2 students in preparation for placement. MBiomedSci: The fourth year of the MBiomedSci programme is in a work-based learning environment where students gain a professional appreciation of a working research laboratory, in addition to completing research and their specified modules of study. This is not assessed per se though participation in the on-going activities of the laboratory (collaborating with colleagues, scheduling experimentation, ordering materials and giving seminars on their research work) will be a requirement as directed by the student\u2019s Mentor. BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DL) and Graduate Certificate: There are no work-based learning components in the BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DL) and Graduate Certificate programmes. However, the majority of students enrolled on these programmes are working in NHS pathology laboratories. These students typically benefit from having Ulster-based academic advice, module-specific e-tutor support through BBLearn and work-based supervisor advice for the duration of their studies. The work-based supervisor(s) also acts as guarantor(s) for assessment and exam purposes. The eLSU communicates closely with guarantors and students throughout to ensure the meticulous monitoring of assessment, which is managed electronically through BBLearn Together, this supportive infrastructure ensures that students who are experiencing difficulty, perhaps because of the nature of DL study, or through disability or personal circumstances are quickly identified and can be helped accordingly. Ulster\u2019s student support services are also available for DL students. Employability Employability is one of the key Student Learning Principles, stating: \u2018Ulster Students will develop the knowledge and skills to be confident and capable of competing for, and succeeding in, stimulating and fulfilling employment through the provision of opportunities designed into their programme of study. A student\u2019s whole experience at Ulster contributes to successful employability.\u2019 Further information is available at Employability and Careers at Ulster University. In accordance with this, the School\u2019s objective is to provide students with learning experiences that give them the confidence, knowledge and skills to enable them to take up stimulating, challenging, and fulfilling employment opportunities and to contribute to the further development and advancement of their chosen profession. The new Ulster student \u2018Employability Journey\u2019 will provide a mechanism to support the measurement of and progress of students on their employability journey. Employability is therefore embedded into all courses with support for all students, including those with disabilities. Accreditation of biomedical science programs will enhance student\u2019s opportunities to pursue professional career paths in the bio- and healthcare science sectors. To this end, the School has long-standing reputation for research- and scholarship-driven teaching and learning, producing highly employable graduates and Ulster sustains an excellent reputation with the vast majority of students directly entering employment (or engaging in further study and/or research) upon graduation. The School is represented on the Faculty Employability sub-committee by various lecturers who can in turn inform students about new opportunities to develop employability skills. Encouraging biomedical science undergraduate students to pursue relevant sandwich placements (including study or work abroad) with robust support before, during, and after placement helps ensure they make the very best of the placement opportunity. Undergraduate students can also choose to undertake study or work abroad options. In addition, undergraduate biomedical science students are encouraged to participate in activities that lead to achievement of the Ulster EDGE Award (see Section B2.10.6 below), designed to enhance the employability of students by encouraging engagement with, and official recognition of, extra-curricular and cocurricular activities and achievements including volunteering, sporting activity, involvement with the Student\u2019s Union etc. The Award is taken in addition to a degree and enrolment is free. In addition, the School has an excellent relationship and engagement with the University Career Development Centre that provides additional high-quality support for all students, offering one to-one guidance, access to thousands of opportunities for graduate employment, internships, and part-time work during study. Bespoke careers advice for biomedical science students is incorporated into the curriculum, including workshops which deal with CVs, job applications and interviews. These sessions in turn are informed by feedback from employers in healthcare, bioscience and pharmaceutical industries, and others, who can clearly outline the qualities they are seeking", "extract": "Ireland, other European countries, or overseas countries under the supervision of experienced biomedical researchers; or Pharmaceutical industry, research and development, or in quality assurance.

volunteering, sporting activity, involvement with the Student\u2019s Union etc. The Award is taken in addition to a degree and enrolment is free. In addition, the School has an excellent relationship and engagement with the University Career Development Centre that provides additional high-quality support for all students, offering one to-one guidance, access to thousands of opportunities for graduate employment, internships, and part-time work during study. Bespoke careers advice for biomedical science students is incorporated into the curriculum, including workshops which deal with CVs, job applications and interviews. These sessions in turn are informed by feedback from employers in healthcare, bioscience and pharmaceutical industries, and others, who can clearly outline the qualities they are seeking in graduates. All students engage in personal development planning which allows them to record and reflect upon their academic and career development. Development of student employability in the School is supported by: engagement with employers; high standards of careers support and advice; skill development explicitly and implicitly within each student\u2019s course of study; scholarship or research; and holistic development of the student within and beyond the academic experience of university life. The planned programmes outlined in this document aims to widen opportunities for graduates by providing the knowledge, critical awareness, and transferable skills that will equip graduates for employment. In reviewing the provision, the Employability Development Opportunities Review Toolkit (EDORT), developed by the Career Development Centre, was used and informs the curriculum design and content. A bespoke Employability Portal https://employability.ulster.ac.uk/ has also been developed, which all students can use to record their skills, achievements and experience in one easily accessible online area. Each student can personalise their e-portfolio, allowing them to easily identify areas which can enhance their employability skills. The portal also provides a range of downloadable resources (e.g. CV builder, templates, statement planner, etc) and direct access to jobs, internships and placement opportunities such as those mentioned below. The Career's team also offers a 'drop in' service for instant support and advice. Handshake: enables students to search and apply for jobs, expand their network and access key employability and career services including advice and events CV360: students can upload their CV and receive instant feedback and scoring based on quality checks Interview360: students can access practice psychometric tests, job interview simulator and self-assessment exercises Digital Learning Hub: students can access Employability & Career's expertise and experience anytime from anywhere Abintegro Career Platform: students can access and practice psychometric tests, job interview simulator and self-assessment exercises Graduate Qualities and Student Experience Principles Consistent with the School and University\u2019s aspiration to be a leading provider of professional education for professional life, graduates from biomedical science programmes will demonstrate Ulster's core Graduate Attributes namely: delivering sustainable futures for all identifies including: collaboration, enhancing potential, inclusion and integrity. All students commencing undergraduate programmes receive a completed national HEAR (Higher Education Achievement Report) document which charts and provides a record of their undergraduate career and includes their graduate qualities. The following narrative directly cross-references modules to indicate facilitation of how students will meet each of the core graduate qualities. Career Opportunities, Development and Progression Biomedical Science is a continually changing and dynamic profession, offering a variety of career opportunities with excellent prospects, including specialist laboratory work, consultancy roles, research, education and management. With this in mind, the Subject team has designed programmes to meet the career and employment needs of both students and employers. This has been achieved through consultation with a number of representatives from a range of academic, educational and industrial backgrounds across the island of Ireland and further afield. In addition, several reports published by government and other agencies that highlight gaps in graduate skills and competencies have been considered in planning the programme. Each of the programmes presented in this Revalidation document are professional programmes that intend to prepare students for work as biomedical scientists (DPP Pathology). The DPP/DIAS and 3-year Biomedical science programmes provide students with the opportunity to pursue a career in research, industry, pathology laboratory, teaching or further studies. The recording of self-promotional and career management skills is introduced to students in Year 1 of the programme (Professional Skills) and is continued through the use of the IBMS Registration Training Portfolio (DPP Pathology) and support HUB https://www.ibms.org/resources/news/introducing-ibms-support-hubs-for-2023/ The teaching and learning methods used throughout the programmes promote the development of graduate qualities in relation to employability and career management. The development of interpersonal, communication, reflective, professional and practical transferable skills in these programmes, together with the support in CV preparation and interview skills, means that graduates are well-placed to enter the world of work, and it is notable that a number of graduates are offered posts with the agency or company with whom they have spent their placement year. A Spotlight Career event was introduced in 2022-2023 whereby all final year students were able to experience a \u2018mock interview\u2019 face to face scenario interviewed by a team of academic staff and external employers. Additionally, the mock interviews followed with an on-campus career employer event jointly organised by the School of Biomedical Sciences and the Employability & Career's Team. UU very much welcomes the opportunities that employers provide to students to enhance their employability at different stages of their journey, and the event proved very successful with 98% of students being in favour of the event (78% very satisfied and 20% satisfied), 95% of students were more aware of their skills that need improvement, and 89% of students believed they were more confident with the process of interviewing skills. We plan to continue with this annual opportunity of the employability strategy enhancing the student experience and increasing skills through quality coordinated engagement with employers. The Spotlight Event offers students from all backgrounds, experience and education levels the opportunity to speak to local and national employer representatives. This event enables a select number of sector specific organisation\u2019s, to have a presence on our Coleraine campus and to meet our students. This will also provide the employers with an", "extract": "extra-curricular and cocurricular activities and achievements including volunteering, sporting activity, involvement with the Student\u2019s

We plan to continue with this annual opportunity of the employability strategy enhancing the student experience and increasing skills through quality coordinated engagement with employers. The Spotlight Event offers students from all backgrounds, experience and education levels the opportunity to speak to local and national employer representatives. This event enables a select number of sector specific organisation\u2019s, to have a presence on our Coleraine campus and to meet our students. This will also provide the employers with an opportunity to raise awareness of their own organisation, advertise placement and graduate opportunities, and connect with our UU students. In addition to such employability opportunities we are delighted to offer a Randox Training Academy in collaboration with our industry partner Randox Laboratories, which was introduced after the Covid-19 pandemic to help upskill our students. The workshops are now a yearly industry led Randox Training Academy scheme for our UU Biomedical students. The workshop of practical training sessions covers key laboratory techniques, as well as industry standard practices and employability skills. The opportunity is open to all year groups. Due to the successful relationship we have developed with our employers, we are in the process of liaising with the associated contacts with the aim of introducing an Employment Liaison Board (ELB), to provide support for those students who perform industrial led placement. The EDGE Award is open to full-time and part-time undergraduate students at Ulster. The Award has been designed to enhance the employability by providing official recognition and evidence of activities outside their programme of study. It is taken in addition to their degree, and it is free to enrol. To achieve the award students can choose from a wide range of activities to enhance their career prospects and also to show future employers they are committed to developing personal and professional skills. To achieve the EDGE Award students need to complete 4 activities which are NOT all from the same category. Students may also be eligible to qualify for the EDGE Excel Award. This award provides recognition for those students who have excelled in the number of activities that they have engaged with outside of their degree programme. To achieve the EDGE Excel Award \u2013 you need to complete 6 activities from across 3 categories. When students graduate from Ulster, the EDGE or EDGE Excel Award will appear on their official transcript. More information is available at: EDGE Award Portal (ulster.ac.uk) Widening Participation The School is fully committed to widening participation and broadening access to Higher Education offering a wide range of full and part time taught programmes at foundation (levels 1-3), undergraduate (levels 4-6) and postgraduate (level 7) level. Students can gain entry to these programmes through traditional and non-traditional entry routes including accreditation of prior experiential learning (APEL) or through the University\u2019s franchise provision in various further education regional colleges. This directly evidences the School\u2019s full commitment to the University\u2019s widening participation agenda. In such exceptional circumstances, where an individual has substantial and significant experiential learning, a portfolio of written evidence demonstrating the meeting of graduate qualities (including biomedical science specific outcomes) may be considered as an alternative entrance route. The School will exercise due regard for all core elements of each programme to ensure that applicants have met requisite learning outcomes within any APEL claims. In terms of exemption, which is determined on a case-by-case basis, certificated evidence must be commensurate with the learning outcomes within the module(s) for which exemption is sought. Learning and educational needs are also identified at point of entry and during Induction Week, and efforts are made to ensure all members of staff are aware of any particular student requirements and considerations, whether APEL- or needs-related, and students are also advised to utilise Student Support Services and the Career Development Centre. All of this helps ensure that each student can utilise and avail of the same educational opportunities and support mechanisms, irrespective of their mode and level of entry onto a programme, in order to maximise their career potential. The two courses offered by DL, BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DL) and the Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science, have been highly successful in addressing the University\u2019s widening participation agenda by attracting a number of students in employment who are able to pursue their studies in a flexible manner which accommodates their working lives. Internationalising the curriculum is an integral part of the emphasis placed on research informed teaching (given internationally excellent/world leading research activities) and employability (work ready for clinical practice, bio and pharma industrial professional role and research which is viewed in an international context).There is widespread use of international textbooks and journal articles, and international case studies, and tasks which require students to compare local and international standards in the biomedical science profession. Through advanced entry into our BSc Hons Biomedical science programmes we have 10 (2023/24) international students from countries such Hong Kong, Nigeria, South Africa, Italy, Ukraine and there has been up to 11 Medical Research Council Gambia students on our BSc Hons Biomedical Science DL PT programme so local students are engaging with another culture and can consider different perspectives. A small number (typically 3 per year) of BSc Hons Biomedical Science students undertake international placements lasting one year. MBMSci Biomedical Science FT students (typically 5) spend a year in a leading clinical research environment in the USA. Work-Based Learning While summative work-based learning is explicitly undertaken by students enrolled on the following programmes: BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science DPP (Pathology); Biomedical Science DPP/DIAS; MBiomedSci; all students can engage in undertaking work experience and work-based learning. Both BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DL) and Graduate Certificate Biomedical Science students are based in the workplace and will complete practical sessions and a project that is directly relevant to bio-", "extract": "98% of students being in favour of the event (78% very satisfied and 20% satisfied), 95% of students were more aware of their skills that need improvement, and 89% of students believed they were more confident with the process of interviewing skills.

A small number (typically 3 per year) of BSc Hons Biomedical Science students undertake international placements lasting one year. MBMSci Biomedical Science FT students (typically 5) spend a year in a leading clinical research environment in the USA. Work-Based Learning While summative work-based learning is explicitly undertaken by students enrolled on the following programmes: BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science DPP (Pathology); Biomedical Science DPP/DIAS; MBiomedSci; all students can engage in undertaking work experience and work-based learning. Both BSc Hons Biomedical Science (DL) and Graduate Certificate Biomedical Science students are based in the workplace and will complete practical sessions and a project that is directly relevant to bio- and healthcare sciences. Work-based learning, either through sandwich placement (BSc Hons students) in the US (MBiomedSci students) or work experience opportunities (all students) will help students evidence their skills in their Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR), Ulster Engagement, Development, Graduate Employment (EDGE) Award and/or their curriculum vitae and is encouraged in order for them to gain additional insights into the application of knowledge in the workplace. The new Employability Portal is designed to increase student awareness of how they can recognise, articulate and evidence skill sets gained from different types of work-based learning, which importantly can also include transferable skills from non-academic experience such as parttime jobs, volunteering and recreational roles. Personal Development Planning Linked to the Employability Portal, Personal Development Planning (PDP) via the HEAR process is designed to assist students to get the most from their time at university, helping them to plan and reflect upon the knowledge and skills they are developing. Progress will be recorded for each student as they undertake activities to enhance their skill set, assisting with career planning and increase employability. This helps students record all their achievements and is secure, confidential and user friendly and allows students to: Link to the Student Record System Record and store evidence, thoughts, and plans Create career, personal and academic action plans. \u2022 Communicate with Course Teams Check exam results. Build multiple CVs Maintain a Personal Journal/Diary Create and share an e-portfolio. PDP has been embedded within the programme and is introduced in year one via the Professional Skills programme where students are introduced to HEAR and EDGE opportunities. First year undergraduate students receive marketing leaflets and videos during the induction session and receive more detailed information on PDP during the Professional Skills Programme tutorials from Career's staff. Training workshops are provided to all academic staff to support individual students regarding the use of the HEAR reports and EDGE awards to support students\u2019 PDP. Engaging in PDP will help to establish routine habits of reflection and of logging evidence for continuing personal and professional development. Students can make the HEAR report available to prospective employers which will contain both the learning outcomes of the programme that the student has undertaken and the student performance. PDP is intended to help students: Become more effective, independent and confident self-directed learners. Understand the different contexts for learning. Understand how they are learning and how they prove what they have learnt. Improve their general skills for study and career management; improve their awareness of the skills they are developing through study of their subject (s). Articulate their personal objectives and evaluate progress towards their achievement. To understand the importance of being able to learn in new situations and to transfer and apply their learning in different contexts. Entrepreneurship Training The School of Biomedical sciences is fully committed to entrepreneurship training of all undergraduate students cognisant of the fact that graduates will pursue many and varied careers in a wide and growing global bio- and healthcare sector. Our School has strategically decided to embed the University\u2019s entrepreneurship learning outcomes within our programmes. This approach makes entrepreneurship training of direct and visible relevance to students including actions, outcomes, and activities that add value in varying ways to those working within, or impacted by, biomedical science. Within this subject the context relates to important work being conducted in diagnostic and other laboratories in meeting the needs of patient care; the development of new automated tests to enhance the effectiveness of patient care; and novel translational research and stratified medicine that offer future opportunities to screen, diagnose, treat, prevent, and cure a spectrum of diseases. Selected assignments across the various programmes assess entrepreneurial knowledge and awareness, challenging students to be creative and innovative in their thinking, particularly in regard to laboratory service, resources, and the commercial exploitation of biomedical research. Module Specific Changes (Refer to Appendix 16 for Module Handbook exemplars). In addition to changes made to adopt the guiding principles above, minor changes, which do not have substantial implications, have been made since the last revalidation, and are shared across the suite of related undergraduate courses within the School of Biomedical Sciences are now managed by the Education Lead, Course Directors and Associate Course Director, all newly employed since the revalidation in 2018. Examples are discussed below. New proposals for approval are discussed in Section A. BMS105 Level 4 module has been renamed \u2018Chemistry and Pharmacology\u2019 since the revalidation in 2018. The rationale for this change was to introduce students early to some of the fundamental concepts of pharmacology and pharmacokinetics. Final year students had commented that they did not would have preferred more of an understanding of pharmacology in the early years of their courses and so this brief instruction was intended to provide an overview of fundamental pharmacology concepts. This was deemed successful vis the nodule feedback reflections. BMS106 is renamed as Practical and Laboratory Skills. The rationale for this change was to give students more hands-on practical experience in Year 1, with additional emphasis on critical thinking, data synthesis, numeracy and literacy. Students can then build upon and improve these skills as they progress through other modules in their courses. This has deemed successful. BMS506 is renamed as Clinical & Molecular Genetics to better reflect the fact that this module", "extract": "so local students are engaging with another culture and can consider different perspectives.

This was deemed successful vis the nodule feedback reflections. BMS106 is renamed as Practical and Laboratory Skills. The rationale for this change was to give students more hands-on practical experience in Year 1, with additional emphasis on critical thinking, data synthesis, numeracy and literacy. Students can then build upon and improve these skills as they progress through other modules in their courses. This has deemed successful. BMS506 is renamed as Clinical & Molecular Genetics to better reflect the fact that this module deals with how the use of genetic technology in the clinic can be used to improve healthcare. A new visiting lecturer Dr McDaid has been employed as part of BMS506 to help engage the students and become more aware of current practice. Dr McDaid is Head of Department at the Department of Clinical Genetics Laboratory, based at the Children\u2019s Health Ireland (CHI) at Crumlin, Dublin and delivers a lecture to our final years based on the role of the clinical geneticist and a clinical genetics laboratory. BMS508 is renamed as Clinical Immunology & Medical Microbiology which provides a clearer link for students to the modules they studied in previous years, helping demonstrate how knowledge and content is reinforced and built upon as they progress. BMS509 is renamed as Molecular Pathology, since the previous \u2018Biology of Disease 2\u2019 nomenclature no longer made sense in light of the name change as to BMS508 above. Additionally, in recent years, the molecular characterisation of cancer and other pathologies has become of crucial relevance in patient treatment and/or management, thus the name change will provide a clearer message and understanding when studying the module. BMS510 is as above renamed as Molecular Pathology, dropping the previous \u2018Biology of Disease 3\u2019 nomenclature better to reflect the content being taught. BMS502 is renamed as Molecular Pathology, dropping the previous \u2018Biology of Disease 4\u2019 nomenclature to better to reflect the content being taught. 3C1a Biomedical Science UG&PG - PB SECTION B2 Specifications BSc (Hons) BSc (Hons) Applied Biomedical Science with DPP (Pathology) 3 - 18 BSc (Hons) BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science 19 - 39 BSc (Hons) BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science 40 - 52 BSc (Hons) BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science with DPP/ DPP[I] / DIAS 53 - 72 GradCert GradCert Biomedical Science 73 - 83 MBiomedSci (Hons) MBiomedSci (Hons) Biomedical Science 84 - 97 Associate Award(s): Diploma in Professional Practice (Pathology) (DPP) Exit Award(s): AB Biomedical Studies, CertHE Biomedical Studies PLEASE NOTE: This specification provides a concise summary of the main features of the course and the learning outcomes that a typical student might reasonably be expected to achieve and demonstrate if he or she takes full advantage of the learning opportunities provided.

Health screen: In order to ensure students safety and to permit them to fully avail of the many learning opportunities provided throughout the course it is important that they have relevant vaccinations. Information on the various relevant vaccinations will be made available to them at Induction. They will also be asked questions about their vaccinations on a Health Declaration Form completed at registration. EVALUATING AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND STANDARDS OF LEARNING AND TEACHING Mechanisms for review and evaluation of teaching, learning and assessment standards include: The Staff Student Consultative Committee: The committee meets a minimum of once each semester to discuss course delivery and related matters and includes student representatives appointed for each year of the programme. The Subject Committee: This committee encompasses all members of academic staff who are involved with the programme and student class representatives. It oversees and monitors all developments within the programme and has responsibility for its design and effective delivery. Module Evaluation: Every module is reviewed and evaluated by students and staff each academic year. External Examiners: Scrutinise examination papers, coursework, student scripts, and submit a written report to the University for consideration by the Subject Committee. National Student Survey: Views of graduates are sought on an annual basis. University Administrative Departments: Statistical data available from the Centre for Quality Enhancement, the Faculty of Life and Health Sciences. Development Centre and the School of Biomedical Sciences is used to internally review the programme, evaluate modules and monitor career progression. Quality Assurance Agency: The programme is designed to ensure compliance with the benchmark criteria and standards defined by the QAA. Professional Accreditation: The programme is accredited by IBMS. Internal Periodic Review: The University has a cyclical five year programme of internal review and revalidation. Module monitoring identifies at risk modules and implements a review process in order to improve the module and address any issues. Employer Views: Are sought via informal feedback mechanisms and through an established Employer Liaison Board. Peer Supported Review: Each year, each member of teaching staff is encouraged to undertake an initiative to improve some aspect of their teaching and learning performance, supported by another colleague within the University. The School operates a Student Assessment of Teaching Questionnaire to provide an opportunity for individual staff to evaluate their teaching and to act on feedback received to enhance and develop their practice. Reports are produced for individual members of staff taking part and qualitative comments in the questionnaire are returned to staff for reflection and development purposes. Average scores for the School for each evaluation statement in the questionnaire are generated based on responses received for the sets of questionnaires completed in each academic year. In addition there are University/Faculty/School Strategies for Learning and Teaching.

They are involved in the moderation and approval of assessments and the moderation of the marking undertaken by internal examiners. INDICATORS OF QUALITY RELATING TO LEARNING AND TEACHING The programme is accredited by the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) for the purpose of providing eligibility to apply for registration with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) as a registered Biomedical Scientist. The programme will be delivered by staff with many year's experience teaching on our UG/PG programmes. Of the academic staff within the School of Biomedical Sciences, over 86% are recognised practitioners (associate/fellow/senior/principal fellows) of the Higher Education Academy (HEA). Many hold the Postgraduate Certificate in University Teaching or Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education Practice (PgCHEP), or hold an alternative equivalent qualification or are registered with ENHANCE and are working towards HEA membership. There are 14 Senior Fellows of the Higher Education Academy (SFHEA) and 2 Principal Fellow of Advance HE (PFHEA) in the School and members of the course team are also members and fellows of the Centre for Professional Practice Enhancement (CPPE) at Ulster. Four members of staff within the School have been awarded Ulster University distinguished teaching fellowships. The quality of teaching is evidenced in a number of ways. Courses within the School of Biomedical Sciences are rated highly in the National Student Survey (NSS).

The Subject Committee: This committee encompasses all members of academic staff who are involved with the programme and student class representatives. It oversees and monitors all developments within the programme and has responsibility for its design and effective delivery. Module Evaluation: Every module is reviewed and evaluated by students and staff each academic year. External Examiners: Scrutinise examination papers, coursework, student scripts, and submit a written report to the University for consideration by the Subject Committee. National Student Survey: Views of graduates are sought on an annual basis. University Administrative Departments: Statistical data available from the Centre for Quality Enhancement, the Faculty of Life and Health Sciences, the Career Development Centre and the School of Biomedical Sciences is used to internally review the programme, evaluate modules and monitor career progression. Quality Assurance Agency: The programme is designed to ensure compliance with the benchmark criteria and standards defined by the QAA. Professional Accreditation: The programme is accredited by IBMS. Internal Periodic Review: The University has a cyclical five year programme of internal review and revalidation. Module monitoring identifies at risk modules and implements a review process in order to improve the module and address any issues. Employer Views: Are sought via informal feedback mechanisms and through an established Employer Liaison Board. Peer Supported Review: Each year, each member of teaching staff is encouraged to undertake an initiative to improve some aspect of their teaching and learning performance, supported by another colleague within the University. The School operates a Student Assessment of Teaching Questionnaire to provide an opportunity for individual staff to evaluate their teaching and to act on feedback received to enhance and develop their practice. Reports are produced for individual members of staff taking part and qualitative comments in the questionnaire are returned to staff for reflection and development purposes. Average scores for the School for each evaluation statement in the questionnaire are generated based on responses received for the sets of questionnaires completed in each academic year. In addition there are University/Faculty/School Strategies for Learning and Teaching.

Their key functions are to contribute to the assurance of the standards of the award and the fair treatment of students. They are involved in the moderation and approval of assessments and the moderation of the marking undertaken by internal examiners. INDICATORS OF QUALITY RELATING TO LEARNING AND TEACHING The programme is accredited by the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS). The programme will be delivered by staff with many year's experience teaching on our UG/PG programmes. Of the academic staff within the School of Biomedical Sciences, over 86% are recognised practitioners (associate/fellow/senior/principal fellows) of the Higher Education Academy (HEA). Many hold the Postgraduate Certificate in University Teaching or Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education Practice (PgCHEP), or hold an alternative equivalent qualification or are registered with ENHANCE and are working towards HEA membership. There are 14 Senior Fellows of the Higher Education Academy (SFHEA) and 2 Principal Fellow of Advance HE (PFHEA) in the School and members of the course team are also members and fellows of the Centre for Professional Practice Enhancement (CPPE) at Ulster. Four members of staff within the School have been awarded Ulster University distinguished teaching fellowships. The quality of teaching is evidenced in a number of ways. Courses within the School of Biomedical Sciences are rated highly in the National Student Survey (NSS). In 2023 the overall School satisfaction rate was 90+% including BSc Applied Biomedical Science DPP Pathology (94.74%), BSc Hons Optometry (96.3%), BSc Hons Human Nutrition (93.33%). BSc Applied Biomedical science DPP Pathology programme achieved 100% overall student satisfaction in 2022. The Guardian League Tables 2024 ranks Biomedical Science teaching as Number 2 in the UK and the number 1 IBMS accredited course in the UK. Staff have been recognised for their teaching excellence in the annual Ulster University Student's Union Learning & Teaching Awards, which are voted for by the students. Staff and placement providers have been successful in the annual UU Impact Excellence Awards, which celebrate civic partnerships and the positive impact our students and academic staff are having on both local and international societies and economies. The majority of staff within the Bio- and Healthcare Sciences Subject Team are internationally recognised experts within their research area and are research active members of the Biomedical Sciences Research Institute (BMSRI).

STRUCTURE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE AWARD Language of instruction: English This programme integrates theory and practice in a range of biomedical science subjects and complementary research studies, and leads to the award a Bachelor of Science Degree with Honours in Biomedical Science (DL). This programme has been introduced primarily to support the career development of associate practitioners in the NHS pathology workforce. Normally, such entrants are Foundation Degree graduates in a relevant science subject who gain accreditation for prior certificated learning totaling 120 credit points at Level 4 and 100 credit points at Level 5. These typical entrants must first successfully complete a bridging module in Molecular Biology and Genetics (20 credit points at level 5) before progressing to 120 credit points of Level 6 studies which are typically taken over 2 academic years. In addition, some entrants are required to take an additional bridging module, Physiology and Anatomy of the Human Body (20 credit points at Level 4). Occasionally, entrants must also first successfully complete bridging modules in Biology (cell biology: 10 credit points as level 4) and/or Biochemistry (10 credits at level 4) which are delivered by our collaborative partner, the Atlantic Technological University (ATU), Sligo. However, entrants who have the requisite relevant 120 credits at Level 4 and 120 credits at Level 5, inclusive of Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Physiology and Anatomy of the Human Body and Molecular Biology and Genetics, can directly enter the suite of Level 6 modules. Bridging modules Biochemistry (10 credits at level 4) Optional (delivered by ATU Sligo) Biology (10 credits at level 4) Optional (delivered by ATU Sligo) Physiology and Anatomy of the Human Body (20 credits at level 4) Optional Molecular Biology and Genetics (20 credits at level 5) Optional Basic knowledge of Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Human Anatomy and Physiology, and Genetics and Molecular Biology is required within an accredited Biomedical Science degree by the IBMS. If a student has little or no formal learning experience in one or more of these subjects then he or she will need to take the bridging module(s). In addition, the Molecular Biology and Genetics module must be studied by any student who does not meet the academic requirements in clinical genetics when evaluated against an IBMS accredited degree curriculum. There are a number of possible combinations based on the basic 120 credit points of Level 6 modules, alongside add-on modules that the student may need to take for IBMS accreditation, as well as there being a September and January start option. An example programme structure for students directly entering the suite of Level 6 modules is: Year 1 Semester I (level 6) Medical Microbiology (15 credits) Compulsory Haematology and Transfusion Science (15 credits) Compulsory The Medical Microbiology module introduces the biology of microorganisms that cause human infection and explores the diversity of pathogenic mechanisms in operation for a range of diseases. Experimental and diagnostic techniques that underpin the discipline are also presented. As such the module covers the academic requirements in microbiology and medical immunology when evaluated against an IBMS accredited degree curriculum. The Haematology and Transfusion Science module provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts in haematology and transfusion science, with emphasis on their relevance in health and disease, as well as an appreciation of the application of these concepts in clinical practice. Semester II (level 6) Clinical Biochemistry (15 credits) Compulsory Research Skills (10 credits) Compulsory Cellular Pathology (15 credits) Compulsory The Clinical Biochemistry module is designed to provide an understanding in clinical biochemistry sufficient to underpin further study in the biomedical sciences. The Research Skills module effectively 'paves the way' for the Project: Applied Biosciences module, enabling students to secure an Honours project topic and select appropriate methodologies in order to achieve project goals. The Cellular Pathology module is designed to meet the changing needs of the cellular pathology laboratory and as such will provide up-to-date theoretical knowledge combined with practical laboratory based work experience. Year 2 Semester I (level 6) Clinical Immunology (15 credits) Compulsory Semester I and II Project: Applied Biosciences (15 credits) Compulsory The Clinical Immunology provides knowledge of key concepts in fundamental and clinical immunology and understanding of the value of applying such knowledge in clinical environments. As such the module covers the academic requirements in immunology and clinical immunology when evaluated against an IBMS accredited degree curriculum. The Project must include an element of primary data collection, and it requires students to carry out a piece of independent research, under supervision, in an area of bioscience, which typically draws on the student's work-place, or is selected from a list of staff specified, non- laboratory based (dry) projects. Semester II (level 6) Molecular Pathology (10 credits) Compulsory Professional Practice in Healthcare Science (10 credits) Compulsory The Molecular Pathology module provides an in-depth understanding of key principles in general and systematic pathology for study in the biomedical sciences. The Professional Practice module develops the core principles of professional practice in Biomedical Science. TABLE BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science (Part-time) SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR LEARNING Students and their learning are supported in a number of ways: Induction Process: Students complete an online induction session in advance of the start of semester in order to introduce them to the Blackboard Learn online learning environment and University resources. Programme Handbook: Each student is provided with access to the programme Handbook available on the Course Support Area through BBLearn. The Handbook contains necessary information regarding the University and School policies, in addition to course specific information. Module Handbook: Describes the content, teaching and assessment schedules and a list of recommended texts for each module delivered. Course Director: Provides the administration of the course. Year Tutors: Each student is assigned a Year Tutor, who is an academic member of the subject team. In addition they may approach the Course Director or any other Course Committee academic staff member should they wish to do so.

Delivery will be campus-based at levels 4 to 6 and via distance learning through the University's virtual learning environment, Blackboard Learn, at level 7. Students who successfully complete levels 4, 5 and 6 may exit the programme with the award of a BSc Hons Biomedical Science. At level 7, students will be placed as an intern in an approved research laboratory. In semester 1 they will take two modules, Applied Research Methods (15 credit points) together with Stem Cell Biology (30 credits). Students will take modules Advanced Scientific Methods and Medical Research Project. Both modules are 'long-thin' modules taken over semesters 1, 2 and 3. The Masters project undertaken must be an independent, original, hypothesis driven investigation of a problem in a relevant area of biomedical science and consistent with their internship. During semesters 2 and 3 of the internship year, students will work under the supervision of a mentor and with the support of an e-tutor and an academic supervisor, the latter at the University. In their project dissertation students must present their findings in the format of a scientific paper of a standard suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. It is expected (though not specifically required) that students will publish their work. TABLE MBiomedSci (Hons) Biomedical Science (Full-time) SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR LEARNING Students and their learning are supported in a number of ways; The Course Director: Provides the administration of the course, Internship Co-ordinators This M.Biomed Sci programme offers the opportunity to students to travel to the US for a one-year internship at collaborating institutions. Both these institutions have appointed Internship Co-ordinators to assist with the requirements of J1 visa applications, health insurance, tax payments and refunds and accommodation etc Induction Processes: All new entrants to the School are briefed during registration week of their year 1 degree and are provided with the vital information necessary for the first few weeks of study. A Professional Skills extra-curricular module assists students in the transition from school to university study and provides an introduction to the biomedical science profession. The School understands the importance of both academic and social integration during induction processes and makes every effort to incorporate both. Programme Handbook: Each student is provided with access to the programme. Handbook available on the Course Support Area through BBLearn. The Handbook contains necessary information regarding the University and School policies, in addition to course specific information. Module Handbook: Describes the content, teaching and assessment schedules and a list of recommended texts for each module delivered. Career Development Centre: A centralised careers service is available to help students develop their employability skills during their time at university and make the transition from university to employment as easy as possible. Direct advice is provided during Semester 1 of second year, to assist students in submitting job applications and preparing for interviews for pre-registration positions. Information Services Department: Through University internet / intranet. Library Services: Students attend introductory and subject specific workshops run by the Faculty library team to provide training and support in searching for scientific information tailored to subject specific requirements. BBLearn Module Resource and Course Support Areas: Students are introduced to these through individual module co-ordinators and Course Director. Student Support Department: Through student counsellors, medical centre staff, financial advisers, accommodation officers, cr\u00e8che facilities and others. Sport and Recreation Department: Students are encouraged to use the sports facilities available on campus and beyond. International Office: Provides support especially for overseas students. Students' Union: Provides student entertainment and refreshment, sport and other special interest clubs and societies in addition to financial support in emergencies and legal advice where required. Chaplaincy: Available to help and support all students regardless of their religion or faith background. CRITERIA FOR ADMISSION Applicants must satisfy the University's general entry requirements. Given that places on the programme are limited students must normally achieve 60% or equivalent in their Honours degree as set out in the prospectus or demonstrate their ability to undertake the course through the accreditation of prior experiential learning (APEL). In addition, applicants shall have passes in three different subjects at GCE A-Level including Chemistry and one other science subject from Mathematics, Physics and Biology, be required to undergo a health check, and to complete successfully an Enhanced Disclosure from AccessNI. Additionally, applicants must provide evidence of their ability to undertake the programme through the accreditation of prior experiential learning. Studies pursued and examinations passed in respect of other qualifications awarded by the University or by another university or other educational institution, or evidence from the accreditation of prior experiential learning, may be accepted as exempting candidates from part of an approved programme provided that they shall register as students of University of Ulster for modules amounting to at least the final third of the credit value of the award at the highest level. EVALUATING AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND STANDARDS OF LEARNING AND TEACHING Mechanisms for review and evaluation of teaching, learning and assessment standards include: The Subject Committee: This committee encompasses all members of academic staff who are involved with the programme and student class representatives. It oversees and monitors all developments within the programme and has responsibility for its design and effective delivery. Module Evaluation: Every module is reviewed and evaluated by students and staff each academic year. External Examiners: Scrutinise examination papers, coursework, student scripts, and submit a written report to the University for consideration by the Subject Committee. National Student Survey: Views of graduates are sought on an annual basis. University Administrative Departments: Statistical data available from the Centre for Quality Enhancement, the Faculty of Life and Health Sciences, the Career Development Centre and the School of Biomedical Sciences is used to internally review the programme, evaluate modules and monitor career progression.

External Examiners: Scrutinise examination papers, coursework, student scripts, and submit a written report to the University for consideration by the Subject Committee. National Student Survey: Views of graduates are sought on an annual basis. University Administrative Departments: Statistical data available from the Centre for Quality Enhancement, the Faculty of Life and Health Sciences, the Career Development Centre and the School of Biomedical Sciences is used to internally review the programme, evaluate modules and monitor career progression. Quality Assurance Agency: The programme is designed to ensure compliance with the benchmark criteria and standards defined by the QAA. Professional Accreditation: The programme is accredited by IBMS. Internal Periodic Review: The University has a cyclical five year programme of internal review and revalidation. Module monitoring identifies at risk modules and implements a review process in order to improve the module and address any issues. Peer Supported Review: Each year, each member of teaching staff is encouraged to undertake an initiative to improve some aspect of their teaching and learning performance, supported by another colleague within the University. The School operates a Student Assessment of Teaching Questionnaire to provide an opportunity for individual staff to evaluate their teaching and to act on feedback received to enhance and develop their practice. Reports are produced for individual members of staff taking part and qualitative comments in the questionnaire are returned to staff for reflection and development purposes. Average scores for the School for each evaluation statement in the questionnaire are generated based on responses received for the sets of questionnaires completed in each academic year. In addition there are University/Faculty/School Strategies for Learning and Teaching. REGULATION OF STANDARDS REGULATION OF STANDARDS Assessment Candidates shall be assessed in the modules for which they have enrolled in each year of study. Within each module candidates shall be assessed by coursework or a combination of coursework and examination. In modules at Level 7 the pass mark for the module shall be 50% for all assessments. The following minimum percentages shall be used as a basis for determining candidates' overall grading: Pass with distinction 70% Pass with commendation 60-69% Pass 50% The assessment results for Levels 5, 6 and 7 of the programme shall determine the overall grading with Levels 5 and 6 normally contributing 20% and 30% respectively of the final degree classification for the M.Biomed.Sci. Honours Degree exit award Pass mark for modules is 40% Performance levels for degree classification are: Class I At least 70% Class II (division i) (IIi) At least 60% and less than 70% Class II (division ii) (IIii) At least 50% and less than 60% Class III At least 40% and less than 50% Honours classification derives 70% from Level 6 and 30% from Level 5 External Examiners There is 1 external examiner. External examiners are academic subject or professional experts appointed from outside the University. Their key functions are to contribute to the assurance of the standards of the award and the fair treatment of students. They are involved in the moderation and approval of assessments and the moderation of the marking undertaken by internal examiners. INDICATORS OF QUALITY RELATING TO LEARNING AND TEACHING The programme is accredited by the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS). The programme will be delivered by staff with many year's experience teaching on our UG/PG programmes. Of the academic staff within the School of Biomedical Sciences, over 86% are recognised practitioners (associate/fellow/senior/principal fellows) of the Higher Education Academy (HEA). Many hold the Postgraduate Certificate in University Teaching or Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education Practice (PgCHEP), or hold an alternative equivalent qualification or are registered with ENHANCE and are working towards HEA membership. There are 14 Senior Fellows of the Higher Education Academy (SFHEA) and 2 Principal Fellow of Advance HE (PFHEA) in the School and members of the course team are also members and fellows of the Centre for Professional Practice Enhancement (CPPE) at Ulster. Four members of staff within the School have been awarded Ulster University distinguished teaching fellowships. The quality of teaching is evidenced in a number of ways. Courses within the School of Biomedical Sciences are rated highly in the National Student Survey (NSS). In 2023 the overall School satisfaction rate was 90+% including BSc Applied Biomedical Science DPP Pathology (94.74%), BSc Hons Optometry (96.3%), BSc Hons Human Nutrition (93.33%). BSc Applied Biomedical science DPP Pathology programme achieved 100% overall student satisfaction in 2022. The Guardian League Tables 2024 ranks Biomedical Science teaching as Number 2 in the UK and the number 1 IBMS accredited course in the UK. Staff have been recognised for their teaching excellence in the annual Ulster University Student's Union Learning & Teaching Awards, which are voted for by the students. Staff and placement providers have been successful in the annual UU Impact Excellence Awards, which celebrate civic partnerships and the positive impact our students and academic staff are having on both local and international societies and economies. The majority of staff within the Bio- and Healthcare Sciences Subject Team are internationally recognised experts within their research area and are research active members of the Biomedical Sciences Research Institute (BMSRI). In the recent Research Excellence Framework (REF2021) exercise, Biomedical Sciences was awarded top- ranking in the UK for world-leading Research Environment, with a score of 100% 4* (world leading), thus providing an exceptional training environment for young researchers. Furthermore, 95% of our research impact was also scored world-leading or internationally excellent.

Such candidates may be exempted at the discretion of the Board from the normal attendance requirements. Where candidates are required to repeat coursework or to take a supplementary examination the original mark in the failed coursework component or examination shall be replaced by a mark of 40% or the repeat mark whichever is the lower for the purpose of calculating the module result. Consequences of failure in each year, other than the final year The consequences of failure shall normally be as follows: Failure in the Final Year (Honours Degree) In the final year the consequences of failure shall normally be as follows: CLASSIFICATION OF FINAL RESULT The overall Honours classification of successful candidates shall normally be based on the assessment results from all Level 5 and Level 6 modules. Normally Level 5 modules shall contribute 30%. The weighting of each module\u2019s contribution to the overall mark shall be determined by the module\u2019s credit value. The table at section 18 indicates the contribution of each module to the final award. For students who are admitted with advanced standing, only Level 5 modules studied as Registered Students of the University shall be included in the calculation of the final Honours degree result provided that modules to a value of at least 60 credit points have been so studied. Classification of Final Result (Honours Degree) The following percentages shall be used to determine candidates\u2019 overall gradings: Class I At least 70% Class II (division i) (IIi) At least 60% and less than 70% Class II (division ii) (IIii) At least 50% and less than 60% Class III At least 40% and less than 50% Classification of Final Result (exit awards) Provided that they have not been exempted from modules amounting to more than 160 credit points, candidates who do not satisfy the requirements for the award of a Degree or an Honours Degree and have passed the required modules at Level 5 shall be assessed for the award of an Associate Bachelor\u2019s degree. Provided that they have not been exempted from modules amounting to more than 60 credit points at Level 4, candidates who do not satisfy the requirements for the award of a Degree, an Honours Degree or an Associate Bachelor\u2019s Degree and have passed the required modules at Level 4 shall be assessed for the award of a Certificate of Higher Education. For students on the international Integrated Foundation Year (STE pathway), provided that they have not been exempted from modules amounting to more than 60 credits at the lowest level, candidates who do not satisfy the requirements for the award of an Honours Degree, an Associate Bachelor\u2019s Degree, or a Certificate of Higher Education and have passed the requisite modules at Level 3 and Level 4, shall be assessed for the award of Diploma in International Foundation Studies. The assessment results for all modules at Level 5 shall determine the overall grading of the Associate Bachelor\u2019s degrees, and all modules at Level 4 (apart from Year 0) shall determine the overall grading of the Certificate of Higher Education. For students on the international Integrated Foundation Year (STE pathway), the assessment results from the modules in Year 0 of the programme shall determine the overall grading of the Diploma in International Foundation Studies. The weighting of each module\u2019s contribution to the overall result shall be determined by the module\u2019s credit value. The following shall be the minimum overall percentages used to determine the final gradings of candidates.

Candidates shall be assessed in the modules for which they have enrolled in each year of study. Within each module candidates shall be assessed by coursework or a combination of coursework and examination in accordance with the attached table. The pass mark for the module shall be 40%. Where a module is assessed by a combination of coursework and examination and is not a core module a minimum mark of 35% shall be achieved in each element. Where a module is assessed by a combination of coursework and examination and is a core module a minimum mark of 40% shall be achieved in each assessment element.

Students may seek prior consent from the Course Committee to submit coursework after the official deadline; such requests must be accompanied by a satisfactory explanation and in the case of illness of more than five working days by a medical certificate. This application shall be made to the Course Director. Coursework submitted without consent after the deadline shall not normally be accepted. PROGRESS Progress from semester 1 to semester 2 is automatic CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE Candidates who fail to satisfy the Board of Examiners in assessment may be permitted at the discretion of the Board to represent themselves as specified in for one or more supplementary examination and repeat such coursework or other assessment requirements as shall be prescribed by the Board. Such candidates may be exempted at the discretion of the Board from the normal attendance requirements. Where candidates are required to repeat coursework or to take a supplementary examination the original mark in the failed coursework component or examination shall be replaced by a mark of 40% or the repeat mark whichever is the lower for the purpose of calculating the module result. 14.2 In each year, the consequences of failure shall normally be as follows: CLASSIFICATION OF FINAL RESULT The results of candidates who have successfully completed the Graduate Certificate shall be graded in order of merit as Pass with Distinction, Pass with Commendation and Pass. The assessment results for all modules (Level 6) shall determine the overall grading. The weighting of each module\u2019s contribution to the final result shall be determined by the module\u2019s credit value. The following shall be the minimum overall percentages used to determine final gradings of candidates: ILLNESS AND OTHER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES The Board of Examiners may in the case of candidates who are prevented by illness or other sufficient cause from taking or completing the whole or part of the assessment, or whose results are substantially affected by illness or other sufficient cause: permit the candidate to complete, take, or repeat the examination or course work or both at an approved subsequent date or deem the candidate to have passed and recommend the award of an Aegrotat Graduate Certificate. Before an Aegrotat award is recommended a candidate must have indicated that he or she is willing to accept the award.

Candidates shall be assessed in the modules for which they have enrolled in each year of study Within each module candidates shall be assessed by coursework or a combination of coursework and examination in accordance with the attached table. The pass mark for each module shall be 40%. Where a module is assessed by a combination of coursework and examination and is not a core module a minimum mark of 35% shall be achieved in each element. Where a module is assessed by a combination of coursework and examination and is a core module a minimum mark of 40% shall be achieved in each assessment element. Modules in which a minimum mark of 40% is required to be achieved in each element (coursework / examination) are listed below: BIO318 Molecular Biology and Genetics BMS524 Medical Microbiology BMS514 Haematology and Transfusion Science BMS516 Clinical Biochemistry BMS527 Cellular Pathology BMS525 Clinical Immunology SUBMISSION OF COURSEWORK Coursework shall be submitted by the dates specified by the Course Committee. Students may seek prior consent from the Course Committee to submit coursework after the official deadline; such requests must be accompanied by a satisfactory explanation and in the case of illness of more than five working days by a medical certificate. This application shall be made to the Course Director. Coursework submitted without consent after the deadline shall not normally be accepted. PROGRESS Subject to 14 hereof, candidates are required to pass all modules in each year of study in order to proceed to the next. Progress from semester 1 to semester 2 is automatic. CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE Candidates who fail to satisfy the Board of Examiners in assessment may be permitted at the discretion of the Board to represent themselves as specified in for one or more supplementary examination and repeat such coursework or other assessment requirements as shall be prescribed by the Board. Such candidates may be exempted at the discretion of the Board from the normal attendance requirements. Where candidates are required to repeat coursework or to take a supplementary examination the original mark in the failed coursework component or examination shall be replaced by a mark of 40% or the repeat mark whichever is the lower for the purpose of calculating the module result. 14.2 Failure in the Level 6 Studies (Honours Degree) CLASSIFICATION OF FINAL RESULT The overall Honours classification of successful candidates shall normally be based on the assessment results from all Level 5 and Level 6 modules. Normally Level 5 modules shall contribute 30%. The weighting of each module\u2019s contribution to the overall mark shall be determined by the module\u2019s credit value. The table at section 18 indicates the contribution of each module to the final award. For students who are admitted with advanced standing, only Level 5 modules studied as Registered Students of the University shall be included in the calculation of the final Honours degree result provided that modules to a value of at least 60 credit points have been so studied. Classification of Final Result (Honours Degree) The following percentages shall be used to determine candidates\u2019 overall gradings: Class I At least 70% Class II (division i) (IIi) At least 60% and less than 70% Class II (division ii) (IIii) At least 50% and less than 60% Class III At least 40% and less than 50% ILLNESS AND OTHER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES Final year (Honours Degree) The Board of Examiners may in the case of candidates who are prevented by illness or other sufficient cause from taking or completing the whole or part of the final stage assessment or whose results are substantially affected by illness or other sufficient cause: permit the candidate to complete, take, or repeat as candidates for the Honours Degree, the assessment in one or more modules at an approved subsequent date; or deem the candidate", "extract": "in addition to studying 120 credits at level 6, the successful applicant will first have to study Physiology and Anatomy of the Human Body (20 credits - level 4) and/or Molecular Biology and Genetics (20 credits - level 5).

AIMS To introduce the concept of information transfer within each cell from DNA through RNA to protein and beyond. To introduce the genetic defects that contribute to human disease and how their inheritance patterns can be studied. To introduce the concept that cancer is a genetic disease. To provide an appreciation of how molecular biology techniques can be used for the diagnosis of genetic disease and the potential of new treatments. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Appreciate the historical context and key ethical issues involved in the study of genetics and understand the structure and function of nucleic acids and the mechanisms of human inheritance. Describe the main types of mutations, using examples to explain how gain and loss of function mutations relate to phenotype and human health; and discuss how advances in human multi-omics (Genomics, Epigenomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics and Microbiomics), gene therapy and prenatal screening will impact on the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. Explain the principles of core techniques in molecular biology and their current and potential applications in clinical diagnostic and research laboratories and interpret and appraise the application of a diverse range of molecular biology protocols. CONTENT Lectures Overview of DNA structure and function. Effect of DNA mutations on human health. Contemporary molecular biology techniques for the study of applied genetics. Mutation and DNA damage (alterations in chromosome number, gross chromosomal aberrations, point mutations and inborn errors of metabolism; DNA repair) Human Genome Project and its impact. Cancer Genetics. Inheritance: monogenic and multifactorial inheritance, mutation and disease. Pharmacogenomics/stratified medicine. Genetic testing and counseling. Approaches to treating genetic disease. Molecular pathology and specific disease examples. Multi-omics approaches to human disease. Module content is designed to align with SDG 3 by providing students with an understanding of how genetics can be utilised to promote well-being and to aid in our understanding of transmission of inherited disease through a family; that cancer is a genetic disease; the likely response of an individual to therapeutic drugs; how mutations in DNA alter the proteins produced; and the multiple levels at which gene expression is controlled. SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. Finally, the module also aligns with SDG 5, 8 and 9. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Lectures will be used to deliver the key principles underpinning genetic defects that contribute to human disease conditions, molecular methods used for diagnosis and new treatments of genetic disease. Tutorials will guide students on accessing current scientific publications and promote discussion on advances in human genomic and gene therapy and prenatal screening, and the application of a diverse range of molecular biology techniques. Students will interact with the e-tutor via online discussion, email and collaborate within BBLearn. Students will be given a tutorial on BLAST, PRIMER3 and NEBcutter bioinformatic analysis, primer design and restriction enzyme analysis, so as to help with preparation of the bioinformatics assignment. The module is offered fully online. Anyone who wishes to gain practical experience of some of the techniques covered in the module (DNA extraction, PCR, restriction enzyme digestion, gel electrophoresis) will have the opportunity to attend a one-day workshop in December at the Coleraine campus. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written assignment [50%] Part 1 Bioinformatics Assignment 20% Students will use bioinformatic programs to design PCR primers to amplify a particular region of the human genome containing a disease-causing mutation. They will then investigate whether this can be detected using restriction enzymes. (word count equivalence 500 words). Written feedback will be provided via BBL. Part 2 Scientific paper assignment 80% Students will be given data from a population-wide genetic screen for a mutation detected by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. They will be required to prepare the Materials & Methods, Results, Discussion and References sections of a suitably formatted scientific paper (1700 words, not including references). Written feedback will be via a rubric. Written examination [50%] The written examination (2 hours duration) will contribute 50% to the overall module mark. The closed book examination will be divided into three Sections. Section A (22% of the marks) will comprise 22 MCQs to cover the entire course (all questions must be answered), Sections B and C (each worth 39% of the marks) will consist of short-answer questions to cover the entire course (students must answer 3 from a choice of 5 from each section). Within this module, both coursework and written examination elements must meet the threshold standard for the module to be passed. The coursework must be passed overall, not each individual component. 50% Coursework 50% Examination READING LIST Required: Jorde, Lynn B, Carey, John C and Bamshad, Michael J, 2016 Medical Genetics 5th edition, Amsterdam, Elsevier. library.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module considers genetic defects that contribute to human disease with study of recombinant DNA techniques, human inheritance, chromosomal aberrancies and inborn errors of metabolism, carcinogenesis and ageing. Advances in molecular genetics and the human genome project are also discussed and provide an appreciation of the potential for improved diagnostics and therapeutics. RATIONALE This module effectively 'paves the way' for the BIO511 Project: Biosciences module. The module is designed to give students the conceptual tools they need in order to make informed decisions, both in relation to their choice of Honours project topic and the methodologies to be employed in order to achieve project goals, thereby optimising overall performance. AIMS This module aims to provide students with opportunities to develop writing, planning, interpretation and presentation skills within a research context. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Demonstrate critical understanding of research methods and statistical tests. Formulate the objectives and draw up an appropriate overall experimental plan for a project within a chosen area of scientific research. Critically review scientific literature, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and knowledge gaps Produce a structured literature review on the current state of knowledge within the chosen area of scientific research. CONTENT Designing the investigation: Experimental designs, hypothesis formulation and testing; Research governance and ethics, Health and safety, project logbooks Interpreting data: Types of data; Descriptive statistics, central tendency and variability; Significance; inferential statistics, parametric tests - t-test, analysis of variance, non- parametric tests, correlation and regression analysis, chi squared test. use of MS Excel and SSPS. Writing a literature review; conducting effective literature searches, critically reviewing literature, in-text citation and references. The module content aligns with SDG 5, 8 and 9, SDG4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Lectures will be used to deliver key concepts on the theory and methodology of research design and statistical analysis as used in the biosciences. These will provide students with an appreciation of the different bio-statistical research methodologies and will equip them to choose an appropriate research design for their BSc Honours project. Learning materials for the lectures will be provided within Blackboard Learn. Tutorials will guide students on their project plan, scope and direction of the literature review. Students will be expected to interact with the e-tutor via online discussion, email and collaborate within Blackboard Learn. Practical exercises within Blackboard Learn will provide students with experience in the use of MS Excel and SPSS to analyse data arising from a number of bioscience research areas. Students can download a free copy of SPSS from the university homepage. Students will be directed to read relevant scientific papers as appropriate to their chosen Project topic. The module will be offered fully on-line. An important part of the Research Skills module will be the Honours project selection process. Students intending to do a work-based project will discuss possible projects within their place of work. They will have the guidance of an e-tutor to develop the project. Students are advised to opt for projects that are straightforward and low risk, and to avoid studies which require regulatory approval outside the university because of the time it can take to get approval in place. Method comparison and method development projects are encouraged as the ethical approval process is relatively straightforward. Similarly, projects that involve previously collected, anonymised samples are more straightforward than those that involve the collection of new blood or tissue samples. A requirement for a \"work-based\" project is that the student can provide the contact details of someone in their work place willing to act as a project supervisor who has knowledge of the topic selected for the project. Generally, the supervisor is a manager/senior colleague who holds a BSc Hons degree, is familiar with the research topic and is available for regular research discussions. By week 6, students will have identified a suitable work-based supervisor and agreed a project title. They will send a brief description of the project to the e-tutor and module co-ordinator to assess its suitability. The e-tutor will advise on ethical considerations. Students that are not able to do a work-based project will be sent a list of 'dry' data-based project titles (and a short project description) offered by various academic staff in the School of Biomedical Sciences. 'Dry' projects may involve the analysis of data which has been generated from the various research groups or data which has been accessed from databases. Students will be asked to send a list of their preferred projects in rank order to the module co-ordinator who will then allocate projects by the end of week 6. Every research project conducted by students at Ulster must be evaluated by our Ethics Filter Committee, even if a project does not require ethical approval from any other regulatory body. Each student will be responsible for submitting an application and approval from the Filter Committee must be in place before the BIO511 Project: Biosciences module commences. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written assignment [20%] Coursework 1 Statistical analysis of bioscience data (20%) Students will be provided with two sets of data from a biosciences research project and a series of questions which require statistical analysis an interpretation to answer. (WCE 200) Written feedback will be provided on a bespoke feedback sheet, giving the breakdown of marks and answers to the questions. Written assignment [80%] Coursework 2: A portfolio of two pieces of assessment: Part 2 and 3 are linked assignments Part 2 Project Brief (30%) Students will write", "extract": "2019 Human Molecular Genetics 5th edition, Boca Raton, Florida Available as an e-book through the university library.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module aims to provide students with the opportunity to develop key research and transferable skills. Students will be expected to select a research project topic and then write a project brief and a literature review, and also use MS Excel and SPSS to analyse bioscience data sets. RATIONALE This module draws upon research skills attained in previous study (BIO509 Research Skills in Biosciences module) and provides students with the opportunity to undertake an independent investigation in an area of biosciences. The module provides experience in project planning, data collection/handling/analysis and interpretation, thereby developing a range of research and transferable skills. The project can also allow students in the work place to carry out an investigation which not only benefits their employer but also their career. AIMS This module aims to provide students with an opportunity to perform an independent, supervised, relevant, in-depth investigation of a specific topic in the field of biosciences. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Define an appropriate detailed research strategy and plan in order to fulfil the project objectives. Show initiative and skill in applying methods and techniques relevant to the project. Analyse and interpret the data obtained during the execution of the project, and critically compare and integrate project findings with findings from previous work reported in the literature. Produce a structured report on the investigative project. CONTENT The project will be an individual study of an area of biosciences related to biomedical science, biotechnology or food science applications. Each student, with supervision, will be expected to demonstrate their ability to: critically review the relevant sources of information on a research topic chosen previously within the BI0509 Research Skills in Biosciences module; define how the topic, for which research objectives have been set, is to be investigated, design a programme of investigation, carry out the work and respond to results; analyse and interpret the data and compare the results to other studies and establish valid conclusions; and present, with the use of appropriate aids, their research findings in the format of a scientific paper. Research topics are diverse. Students will previously have identified a research topic within the BIO509 Research Skills in Biosciences module. Normally the research will take the form of a problem solving, practice improvement or new opportunity realisation exercise within the student's work-place or analysis of data arising from a scientific investigation in the field of biosciences. The module aligns with SDG 5, 8 and 9. SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Students will be expected to carry out individual independent project work. The majority of students carry out a work-based project. Students not currently working in a lab environment may undertake a 'dry' data-based project offered by academic staff at ulster. 'Dry' projects are varied and reflect the research interests of staff. These projects may involve the analysis of data which has been generated from the various research groups at Ulster or data which can be accessed from databases. The project may not commence until approved by the Ethics Filter Committee at Ulster. Students will have the support of: Work-Based Supervisor (for a work-based project) In case of a work-based project, as part of the project proposal and planning in BIO509 Research Skills in Biosciences module, students must have identified someone in their workplace willing to act as their project supervisor. This person provides guidance and advice on the day-to-day running of the project and gives direction to the progress of their research. Generally, the supervisor is a manager/senior colleague who holds a BSc Hons degree, is familiar with the research topic and is available for regular research discussions. 'Dry' project supervisor (for a data-based project) In the case of a data-based project, the 'dry' project supervisor provides guidance and support throughout the duration of the project either via regular Teams meetings or email.

someone in their workplace willing to act as their project supervisor. This person provides guidance and advice on the day-to-day running of the project and gives direction to the progress of their research. Generally, the supervisor is a manager/senior colleague who holds a BSc Hons degree, is familiar with the research topic and is available for regular research discussions. 'Dry' project supervisor (for a data-based project) In the case of a data-based project, the 'dry' project supervisor provides guidance and support throughout the duration of the project either via regular Teams meetings or email. E-tutor All students have access to an e-tutor, who is a specialist in the areas associated with the projects. The e-tutor will: Be available for consultation on all research matters relating to the preparation and execution of their project. This may involve advising students on the planning and implementation of their research. Provide advice, if sought, to work-based supervisors Report on student's progress to the module co-ordinator Advise students on keeping a laboratory notebook, COSHH and risk analysis Advise students that all work relating to their project must be entered into their lab book Answer any queries regarding statistics relevant to any project. The work-based and 'dry' project supervisors will not instruct each student in a step-by-step manner (as this would weaken the independence of each student), but rather interactively discuss appropriate approaches to work and the interpretation of results, etc. with each student. Each student must maintain a laboratory notebook/ logbook of project-related activities. This will help ensure that the project is conducted with a due degree of scientific rigour. Failure on the part of each student to submit a properly-maintained notebook may be considered grounds for a 'fail' mark in this module. The work-based and 'dry' project supervisors will provide critical feedback in relation to drafted sections of the project report produced towards the end of the project by each student. This feedback will be vital to ensure that all the learning outcomes within the project are realised. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Project [90%] Students will be expected to write up their research findings in the form of a scientific paper, following the structure and specifications provided. Although written in the form of a scientific paper, there will invariably be a certain amount of relevant information (e.g. summaries of important 'pre-trial' work, relevant samples of raw data) that does not properly belong in the scientific paper, but which should, nonetheless, be included in some way. Such additional material should be included as 'appendices' to the project report. Given that the nature and quantity of such information will depend on the exact type of project, the supervisor should provide guidance for the student regarding this. The project write-up should be no more than 30 pages of text, including diagrams and bibliography but excluding appendices. The whole document should not exceed 35 pages. (WCE 3000) Each project report will be independently marked, with equal weighting, by a member of academic staff within the School of Biomedical Sciences at Ulster, and the student's allocated e-tutor. Both will assess the project report using clearly defined criteria. If there is a difference of more than 10% between the first and second markers of the project report, and if the two markers are unable to align, then the module co-ordinator, will review the project report. Written feedback will be provided via a rubric with additional comments as appropriate. Practical skills assessment [10%] The practical achievement of each student for the full duration of the project will be assessed by the work-based supervisor or 'dry' project supervisor. This will take into account all aspects of the preparation and execution of the project. Written feedback will be provided on a bespoke feedback sheet, giving the breakdown of marks and comments. These reports are confidential and students will not read them. 100% Coursework 0% Examination READING LIST Required: Peer-reviewed journals relevant to the particular area of investigation. Recommended: Students will be directed to online database resources including PubMed Central, Web of Knowledge: ISI Proceedings and Web of Knowledge: ISI Web of Science. SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This investigative project is an independent piece of work completed by the student designed to develop key research and transferable skills in a discipline relevant to biomedical sciences/biosciences. RATIONALE Well-planned research is the basis for increasing our understanding in the field of Biomedical Sciences and essential for the successful execution of any research project. As you work through this module, you'll gain an appreciation of the scientific method, the concept of a hypothesis, the ability to critically assess published work, and a practical understanding of the application (and limitations) of biostatistical techniques. This module also examines ethical theory and the codes of practice and legislation required for carrying out research or healthcare practice. An understanding of research governance procedures will provide you with a better understanding of the requirements for obtaining ethical approval and thus expedite the approval process for future research projects. AIMS To provide a description of the scientific method, including an approach to the critical analysis of published work and the application of biostatistical techniques. To provide students with an understanding of ethical theory and research governance procedures and their implications for research and professional practice LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Demonstrate a capability to summarise and produce a critical review of the available literature as it informs current understanding of knowledge in a chosen field of scientific study. Design and develop a novel, masters level project proposal worthy of further scientific investigation and appropriately supported by underpinning information of costs, timing, ethical and health and safety matters Demonstrate a systematic approach to data handling and statistical analysis in order to validate hypotheses and interpret research data Gain an appreciation of ethical theory and the workings of research governance and its pathways within a multidisciplinary environment and make appropriate applications within such a system identifying the", "extract": "part of the project proposal and planning in BIO509 Research Skills in Biosciences module, students must have identified someone in their workplace willing to act as their project supervisor.

{"id": "chunk-66", "title": "Section 67", "text": "their implications for research and professional practice LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Demonstrate a capability to summarise and produce a critical review of the available literature as it informs current understanding of knowledge in a chosen field of scientific study. Design and develop a novel, masters level project proposal worthy of further scientific investigation and appropriately supported by underpinning information of costs, timing, ethical and health and safety matters Demonstrate a systematic approach to data handling and statistical analysis in order to validate hypotheses and interpret research data Gain an appreciation of ethical theory and the workings of research governance and its pathways within a multidisciplinary environment and make appropriate applications within such a system identifying the agencies that need to be involved or informed. CONTENT Indicative content: Discussion of the scientific method and study design Laws of Probability - fundamental ideas of probability and distribution theory Statistical analyses incorporating: Method Comparison studies, Observational Studies, Control Studies, Factorial Design and Advanced Methods Research Ethics and Governance Module content is designed to align with SDG 3 by providing students with an understanding of how ethics is needed for human studies and as part of this module students will develop a project proposal to promote good health. SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. Finally, the module also aligns with SDG 5, 8 and 9. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Lectures (including tutorials in computation) will be used to deliver key concepts on the theory and methodology of experimental design and statistical analysis as used in the biosciences. These will provide the student with an appreciation of the different biostatistical research methodologies and will equip the student to choose an appropriate research design for their research project. On commencing this module, the student will be provided with support and guidance in the selection of a research topic in their chosen discipline. Facilitated by the module content, together with the support of their work-based supervisor, each student will prepare a research project description. This proposal will be a hypothesis-based project and, where applicable, be consistent with the UK Research Governance Framework. A student's project proposal must have academic approval for the student to proceed to the MSc Project. This module is fully online and students will be supported by an e-tutor throughout the semester. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written assignment [10%] Coursework 1a: Critical Evaluation of Research Ethics Application A critical evaluation of a research ethics application, intended to inform the decision of a research ethics committee in their recommendation for approval or otherwise of an application (500 words maximum). Feedback will be by electronic return (within 20 working days) with comments on the strength of the evaluation and areas for further consideration. This part of assignment 1 will contribute 10% of the module mark. Report [40%] Coursework 1b: Biostatistics Report Use of SPSS to select and apply statistical tests to a range of case studies, interpret results and discuss the limitations of statistical designs; (500 words maximum). Feedback will be by electronic return (within 20 working days). Biostatistics coursework will contribute 40% of the module mark. Written assignment [50%] Coursework 2: Project Proposal A critical evaluation of the relevant literature, a statement of the aim(s) and hypothesis and a description of the intended scientific method, and other areas related to the proposed research (ethics, costing, health & safety); (2000 words maximum). Feedback will be by electronic return (within 20 working days) with comments on the strengths of the proposal and areas for improvement and further consideration before undertaking research project in BMS809 where applicable. The project proposal will contribute 50% of the module mark. This module is assessed by 100% coursework which is split into two pieces of summative assessment; Assignment 1 has been split into two interlinked parts. The assignments focus on the development and application of research methods including critical evaluation of published literature, ethical approval, statistical analysis and development of a research project proposal which is essential for the MSc research project. Students are encouraged to look at the Ulster University assessment criteria for Level 7 work which will provide a context for the level required to achieve a pass mark (50%). The module handbook contains further detail and guidance regarding the nature of each assignment. Students must achieve an overall minimum module mark of 50% in order to pass the module. Students must also obtain a minimum of 50% in the research project proposal (Coursework 2) to proceed to the research project module. Feedback on all assignments will be via electronic return and will be provided within 20 working days of submission. Formative feedback will be provided via regular web chats with e-tutors and online discussion forums. 100% Coursework 0% Examination READING LIST Required: Divan, A.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module provides the foundation for research in Biomedical Sciences. The design of experimental investigations and the use of biostatistical methods are discussed. The module requires the completion of computer practicals, a critical evaluation of published literature, problem-based assessments and issues relating to research governance are included. RATIONALE This module will provide a basic understanding of the biological macromolecules and chemical processes underlying the biochemical reactions which are responsible for life. The concepts introduced in this module will be further developed in later modules of study. STGs: STG3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), STG4 (Quality Education) AIMS The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the structure, function and chemistry of biological macromolecules and the various biochemical pathways that occur in living systems LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Explain how the chemistry and structure of the major biological macromolecules determine their biological properties Outline the major metabolic and catabolic pathways by which cells use energy to produce carbohydrate, lipids and proteins from precursor molecules and briefly describe the regulatory mechanisms involved. Explain the chemical and thermodynamic principles underlying biological catalysis and the role of enzymes and other proteins in determining the function and fate of cells. Undertake biochemistry experiments in a controlled laboratory environment paying particular attention to health and safety procedures and evaluate experimental results in a critical manner. CONTENT The content for this module is designed to align with SDG 3 by providing students with an understanding of the biological molecules and pathways which are responsible for health and wellbeing. SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. Finally, the module also aligns with SDG 5 and 8. The content of this module will include (but is not limited to): Lectures Amino Acids and Proteins: Structural and chemical properties; Essential and nonessential amino acids; Protein structure and function. Enzymes: General properties of enzymes; Catalysis; Enzyme kinetics and regulation. Carbohydrate chemistry: monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides and glycoproteins. Introduction to metabolism: Key concepts and reactions; Glycolysis; Citric Acid Cycle: Enzymes, regulation and reactions of the citric acid cycle and related biochemical pathways. Electron Transport and Oxidative Phosphorylation: Mitochondrial transport systems; Electron transport; Oxidative phosphorylation; Control of ATP production. Glycogen Metabolism, gluconeogenesis and other carbohydrate biosynthetic pathways. Fatty Acids and Lipid Metabolism: Lipid classification, structure and bilayers; Fatty acid oxidation; Ketone bodies; Fatty acid biosynthesis and regulation; Cholesterol. Amino Acid Metabolism: Amino acid deamination; The Urea Cycle; Breakdown and biosynthesis of amino acids. Hormones and hormonal action; Mechanisms of hormonal signalling; Integration and Regulation of Fuel Metabolism: Inter-organ metabolic pathways; Disturbances in fuel metabolism. Nucleic acids and nucleic acid-protein complexes. Practical sessions Basic skills and techniques in the preparation of biological buffers - calculation and measurement of pH. Protein structure and quantitative determinations using spectrophotometric methods. Size-exclusion chromatography including the practical separation of a protein mixture. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Lectures will introduce students to the fundamental principles of biochemistry and related applications to biomedical sciences. Regular tutorials will serve to reinforce the content covered in lectures and involve activities with worked examples. Students should engage in lectures and tutorials and undertake directed reading. Practical sessions will instruct students in the proper use of key laboratory equipment found in a biochemistry laboratory including: glassware, disposables, pH meter, analytical balance, pipettes, micropipettes, spectrophotometer and size exclusion chromatography columns. Students will work in groups but be expected to undertake individual practical exercises with the assistance of demonstrators. Students will be directed to read prescribed sections in the required text in preparation for practical sessions. Outside scheduled teaching sessions students will be encouraged to take part in online collaborative activity using the tool PeerWise. The purpose of this is to encourage independent collaborative learning and ongoing review of module material by writing, answering and commenting upon multiple choice questions. The University is committed to promoting Equality, Diversity and Inclusion and through its learning and teaching methods, aims to ensure all students are treated with dignity and respect. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Class Test [50%] Portfolio of two tests: Two tests in Multiple Choice Question/Short Answer format will be held online through Blackboard for students to complete at an allocated time as instructed. Tests will take place near the middle and end of semester and will cover all aspects of the module. Class tests contribute 50% of the overall module mark (2 x 25%). Equivalency for each test: 45 min to 1 hour each for 10 credits. A support activity for these tests involves an activity using the online tool PeerWise. Students create and share multiple-choice questions based on module content with the rest of the group. PeerWise features aspects of gamification of learning and students obtain badges as they involve themselves in the activity. Students are encouraged to engage with this activity to support their assessment, but it does not contribute any marks to the module. Practical skills assessment [50%] Three pieces of practical coursework based on three practical classes will require students to work within groups and submit individual workbooks for marking. Practical coursework comprises 50% of the total module mark (3", "extract": "J.

Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology, Global Edition, 12th edition, Published by Pearson (June 15, 2023) Recommended: Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach, Dee Unglaub Silvertborn Global Edition, ISBN- 13: 9781292740737 | Published 2024 SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module provides an introduction to the study of human physiology and anatomy to underpin further study of the pathophysiology in health and disease. RATIONALE This module provides insight into cellular basis of body function in healthy individuals. In addition, the cellular basis of a number of human diseases is explored and used to illustrate what happens when basic functions of the cell go wrong. The module also introduces basic aspects of several subjects which will be treated in more detail later in the course including microbiology, genetics and cellular uptake of nutrients. AIMS To impart an understanding of the cellular basis of life and the relevance of studies of cell structure and function at the molecular level to human disease. Furthermore, to provide a foundation for further studies in genetics, microbiology, histology and biochemistry. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Describe the basic structure and function of the various sub-cellular components; Discuss the storage and flow of information in cells from DNA to protein. Rationalize the enormous amount of information available to decide what is relevant to problems, practical reports and short answers. Understand the role of membranes in energy generation and cellular partition Discuss the social interactions between cells and cell signalling CONTENT Module content is designed to align with SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) SDG 3, by providing students with an understanding of how pharmacology and medicine can be utilised to promote well-being and to aid in our understanding response of an individual to therapeutic drugs. SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. Finally, the module also aligns with SDG 5 and 8. The content for this module is designed to align with SDG 3 by providing students with an understanding of good health and wellbeing in the context of biomedical informatics. SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. Finally, the module also aligns with SDG 5 and 8. Practical classes include SDG 9. Lectures The diversity of cellular life Protein structure and interactions The flow of information in the cell Basic molecular genetics Membranes Introductory microbiology Protein transport and uptake The cytoskeleton Cell communication The cell cycle and division Tissue structure and renewal Basic aspects of cancer and development Practical sessions Cell staining and histology DNA isolation and chromosome spreading Protein isolation and measurement Bacterial culture and antibiotics Membrane properties and cell division LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Lectures will provide an outline of current knowledge in the area and indicate how some key discoveries were made. Each lecture will use a medical example to illustrate how knowledge of the particular area of cell biology helps us to understand, diagnose and treat specific disorders. Videos and computer animations will be used where relevant to illustrate key processes. Tutorials will be student-driven, either dealing with questions which are posed prior to or during the tutorial, using specific workbooks, or using example questions from the final exam. Practical exercises will be related to the theory covered in lectures, and will involve hands-on 'wet lab' work completed in pairs as well as extensive use of microscopes. Students need to plan how to approach the task and divide up the work with their partner. Students will be directed to read specific texts or look at particular websites. Each lecture will be keyed to a section of the required textbook to facilitate further independent learning. Students will be expected to spend considerable time finding, studying and learning relevant material themselves. The module is offered by hybrid learning. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written examination [40%] A 2-hour on-line paper under University examination condition which will take the format of MCQs, labelling of diagrams and/or short-answer questions. The written assessment will contribute 40% to the module mark. Portfolio [60%] A portfolio including: Part 1: Practical assessment- Practical Reports which will summarise findings and draw conclusions to an approved standard on each laboratory class. Typically, practical reports (usually 5 in total) may require combination of graphs, tables, diagrams, calculations and MCQs. Practical Reports are equally weighted and will contribute 40% of the module mark. Assessment, for the most part they fill in a practical workbook during the class and hand it in at the end, the exception to this is the microbiology practical, which usually they take away with them, and hand into the prep room a week or so later. Final Practical is online focusing on understanding digital pathology.", "extract": "will be conducted under examination conditions and cover all aspects of the module and will contribute 30% of the module mark.

Portfolio [60%] A portfolio including: Part 1: Practical assessment- Practical Reports which will summarise findings and draw conclusions to an approved standard on each laboratory class. Typically, practical reports (usually 5 in total) may require combination of graphs, tables, diagrams, calculations and MCQs. Practical Reports are equally weighted and will contribute 40% of the module mark. Assessment, for the most part they fill in a practical workbook during the class and hand it in at the end, the exception to this is the microbiology practical, which usually they take away with them, and hand into the prep room a week or so later. Final Practical is online focusing on understanding digital pathology. Part 2 MCQs- One 60-minute online tests will be conducted under examination conditions and cover lecture and practical material. The questions will take the format of MCQs, labelling of diagrams and/or short-answer questions and will be equally weighted and will contribute 20% of the module mark. Feedback via rubrics sheet with comments. Within this module feedback will take the form of: Introduction of learning objectives in the module and teaching sessions by the Module Coordinator / Lecturer Discussions and debates within the lectures, tutorial classes and practical classes. Feedback will be provided within 20 working days. Help, advice and comments in practical classes by lecturers, tutors and/or demonstrators. Specific verbal comments on student work to help indicate progress and develop student understanding.

In addition, it will provide a foundation for further studies in genetics, microbiology, histology and biochemistry. RATIONALE The module is designed to establish a foundation for subsequent study of biochemistry, pharmacology or more advanced topics in general, inorganic or organic chemistry. It comprises general descriptive physical, inorganic and organic chemistry with an introduction to the fundamentals of pharmacology. AIMS To develop an awareness of the principal factors which influence the structure physical behaviour and chemical reactions of organic and inorganic molecules and/or chemical groups. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Account for physical and chemical features of molecules with reference to electronic structure, bonding and reactivity. Identify the main functional groups in organic molecules and describe how they react with a small range of simple reagents and their relationship to the structures of larger molecules with particular relevance to pharmacology. Demonstrate proficiency in a range of laboratory techniques, report the findings of a practical experiment and interpret the results obtained, through application of logic and appropriate mathematical skill. Develop skills in calculations relevant to chemistry; molarity, pH, titrations, thermodynamics, kinetics and pharmacokinetics etc. Lectures Introduction to principles of chemistry: Chemical structures, states of matter, Scientific and chemical units and notation. Electronic structure and bonding: Electrons in atoms; Types of orbital; Ionisation Potential and Electron Affinity; Chemical periodicity and the Periodic Table; Formation of ionic compounds, valence and bonding. Solution properties: Dissolution and solubility; Miscibility; Solutions of electrolytes; Equilibria in solution, and the equilibrium constant; pH, Ka and pKa; Henderson- Hasselbalch equation. Energetics: Introduction to Thermodynamics; Bond energies; Hess's Law; Gibbs Free Energy; Enthalpy and Entropy. Fundamentals of pharmacology and pharmacokinetics Organic chemistry: Introduction to stereochemistry and isomerism; Bond polarity; Classification of reactions and reagents; Alcohols, ethers and amines; Aldehydes and ketones; Carboxylic acids and derivatives; Amino acids, polymerisation and peptide bonds. Tutorials Lecture topics will be discussed during tutorials. Problem areas identified by the students will be further explained and work provided to supplement the lecture material covered and to encourage independent learning. Practicals Laboratory work done during the three/four practical sessions will be chosen to: illustrate concepts and reactions that are met in the lectures; give training in the use of various techniques and apparatus; and provide experience in the laboratory practices and safe procedures required in working with hazardous chemicals. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Lectures will make use of interactive audience response systems such as Nearpod, video resources and PowerPoint materials to engage students in learning. Large-group activities will be used to convey concepts. Tutorials will supplement lecture material with worked examples thus facilitating a problem- solving approach to relevant concepts. Practical exercises will involve use of laboratory equipment and chemicals to organise and conduct a practical experiment thus giving students necessary laboratory skills in a variety of techniques. Students will be directed to read prescribed sections in the required text or other sources as directed by the teaching team to provide a broad appreciation of the subject. Students will be expected to engage fully in learning activities on the module. These will include self-assessment material delivered through the module website, preparation for laboratory classes and reading prescribed material in advance of lectures, tutorials and practical classes. Students are required to engage with feedback offered by staff on student work. The module is offered by hybrid learning.

Lectures will introduce students to key topics which will include discussion and team-work activities, in which students will be encouraged to participate actively. The poster workshop will provide interactive formative feedback in support of the group poster project. Tutorials will provide students with additional practical support relating directly to the current statistics topics. Practical exercises will instruct students in handling and analysing data obtained from experiments. Software packages such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint and SPSS will be used to summarise data and use of appropriate formats to present results. Students will be directed to read a selection of relevant textbooks germane to the subject matter including scientific communication and presentation skills, biostatistics and Biomedical Sciences more broadly. Students will be expected to attend and participate in all lectures, practicals, workshops and tutorials, and engage with the directed reading and self directed study. The module is offered by hybrid learning. Weeks 7-12 the lectures and practical sessions are online. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Project [50%] The project will consist of group preparation and presentation of a poster/ppt summarising the findings of a topic related to careers in biomedical scientist. This assignment will contribute 50% of the module mark 20% of assessment marks for personal reflective log of process with evidence of teamwork (gathered from meeting minutes and self/peer assessment). 80% for preparation of poster using appropriate IT packages, including Scientific Content, including understanding of biomedical scientist role, of which 12% for individual oral communication of poster as part of a group. Students' teamwork will be monitored and commented on (formative feedback will be offered) before the assessment via an interactive poster workshop. Feedback (formative) on the posters/presentations will be offered before students complete their work and also additional feedback will be offered at the completion of the coursework. Individual contribution will be identified and assessed from meeting minutes and self/peer assessment. 100% of the student mark will be based on his/her individual contribution. Word equivalence = 2000. Written examination [50%] A two-hour statistics examination. Students will answer 25 MCQs and 4 from 6 short answer questions. This will contribute 50% to overall module mark. Students will be provided with assessment criteria and detailed rubrics detailing the assessment aspects and marks allocations. These rubrics are detailed within the module handbook and on relevant areas of the modules BlackBoard Learn environment.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module introduces core aspects of biochemistry in clinical and industrial contexts to underpin further study in the biomedical sciences. RATIONALE This module introduces core principles of Histopathology and Cytopathology preparing the student for further in-depth study of disease processes. The module builds on knowledge attained through study of fundamental sciences, including Human Physiology and Anatomy (Level 4) and Medical Cell Biology (Level 4), and provides a foundation for the study of additional modules such as those in final year and the investigative project. SDGs: SDG3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG4 (Quality Education) SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). AIMS To introduce the principles and techniques used in Histopathology, Cytopathology and Molecular Pathology, and to appreciate the applications of macroscopic and microscopic approaches in the study of gross structure and ultrastructure of normal cells and tissues, together with the structural changes which may occur during disease. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the core scientific terminology, principles and techniques of Cellular Pathology that underpin clinical practice, including aiding diagnosis, treatment selection and management. Describe gross structure and ultrastructure of normal cells and tissues, recognizing structural changes associated with the aetiology, pathology, and progression of disease. Correctly discriminate between healthy and abnormal tissues and cells and identify tissue type/origin /pathology based on microscopic features. Effectively articulate, evaluate, and reflect on outcomes from personal engagement in practical work demonstrations, reported in a case study portfolio. Indicative Lecture Session Content (and Related Practical Material) Introduction to Cellular Pathology - overview, key terminology and principles; Cellular Pathology in clinical context - personnel, legislation, organization of laboratory and services, pathological processes affecting tissues/cells, laboratory information management systems (LIMS), and supplementary laboratory work, Quality control and assurance (including IQC and EQA) and Cell Pathology Accreditation (UKAS and ISO 15189).

Feedback In addition to receiving their individual marks, students will be provided with rubrics mark and feedback. The class will be given feedback on performance with advice for improvement/enhancement. Regular formative assessment opportunities will be offered throughout the module and students are strongly encouraged to engage with all formative assessment exercises in order to self-evaluate personal progress with learning. Summative assessment of this module is through Coursework (100%) primarily undertaken during Weeks 01 to 06 of the module. Details of summary marking standards for mark bands/grades, etc. will be given. As always, students should be vigilant with regards avoiding plagiarism in submitted work. A minimum mark of 40% must be achieved in each element of assessment [coursework and examination] in order to pass the module. Feedback will come in many different forms and channels. Given this, it is important that students pay attention to the oral feedback and comments they are receiving in and out of class, and written feedback on assignments including rubrics. Students should be constantly alert and mindful of the feedback offered to them. Each assessment is accompanied by a specific rubric spreadsheet containing a section for comments. Within this section, students will receive both a grade and feedback. Within this module feedback will take the form of: Introduction of learning objectives in module/classes, and by Module Co- Ordinator/Tutor(s). General comments made in lectures/tutorials/seminars (e.g. discussion and debate - in- class or online). Tips on how to best approach assignment(s) and examination(s) to maximize student learning and performance. Help, advice, and comments in practical sessions by Tutors and/or Demonstrators. More specific verbal comments about work, progress, and performance, in and out of class. Specific written comments on work to help indicate progress and develop understanding. Guidance and advice on academic progress from assigned Studies Advisor(s) and other Staff 100% Coursework 0% Examination READING LIST Required: Students will receive learning material in the format of a series of handouts/handbooks/workbooks/other material (mostly via BBLearn Learn), and will be directed to a range of up-to-date eLearning and online resources, including relevant scientific literature and other reading material. Students are strongly advised to conduct their own independent reading/learning following guidance from the Tutors delivering the module and individual Tutors may advise other textbooks/reading material.

Emphasis on competencies (knowledge, skills and behaviours) and illustration if innovation and employability opportunities will provide an employability and entrepreneurship focus in biomedical science, thereby aligning with UNESCO Sustainability Goals 8 & 9. This module will be delivered by lectures, practical classes and tutorials. The lectures will contain content which will provide students with an understanding of key concepts in haematology. The practical classes will allow students to perform haematology techniques from first principles, thereby putting knowledge gathered in lectures into practice. A tutorial will support revision activities. The module is supported by extensive learning materials placed within the Virtual Learning Environment Blackboard Learn, which students can access using their allocated login and password details. These include self-assessment quizzes, case studies, publications and relevant web-links to assist in their studies. Students are expected to engage with these materials in order to maximise their learning experience. The module is offered by hybrid learning. The module will offer inclusive on-campus and online environments for learning that anticipate and accommodate the varied requirements of learners and ensures equitable access to educational opportunities. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Portfolio [50%] Coursework : Practical Assessment A portfolio of practical assessment will assess students on their ability to perform experiments, present & interpret data and write scientific reports. One practical report (~1,500 words) and one extended abstract (~300 words) will be submitted electronically using drop-boxes available within the module area. Individual feedback will be written and detailed against each criteria as appropriate. Practical skills will be assessed by experiments during each practical session, supported by associated quizzes in 3 classes (~200 words total). Extra information and guidelines on reports, assessment criteria and submission will be provided in the module area throughout the duration of the module, including exemplars of reports at different mark levels.

RATIONALE This module introduces core principles of clinical and applied genetics and contemporary molecular methods sufficient to underpin further study and research in the biomedical sciences. AIMS To introduce the concept of information transfer within each cell from DNA through RNA to protein and beyond. To introduce the genetic defects that contribute to human disease and how their inheritance patterns can be studied. To introduce the concept that cancer is a genetic disease. To provide an appreciation of how molecular biology techniques can be used for the diagnosis of genetic disease and the potential of new treatments. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Appreciate the historical context and key ethical issues involved in the study of genetics and understand the structure and function of nucleic acids and the mechanisms of human inheritance. Describe the main types of mutations, using examples to explain how gain and loss of function mutations relate to phenotype and human health; and discuss how advances in human multi-omics (Genomics, Epigenomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics and Microbiomics), gene therapy and prenatal screening will impact on the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. Explain the principles of core techniques in molecular biology and their current and potential applications in clinical diagnostic and research laboratories and interpret and appraise the application of a diverse range of molecular biology protocols. Develop the skills needed to plan and conduct an investigation of human genetic disease. CONTENT Lectures Overview of DNA structure and function. Effect of DNA mutations on human health. Contemporary molecular biology techniques for the study of Applied Genetics. Mutation and DNA damage (alterations in chromosome number; gross chromosomal aberrations; point mutations and inborn errors of metabolism; DNA repair). Human Genome Project and its impact. Cancer Genetics. Inheritance: monogenic and multifactorial inheritance, mutation and disease.. Pharmacogenomics/stratified medicine. Genetic testing and counseling. Approaches to treating genetic disease. Mendelian Genetics. Molecular pathology and specific disease examples. Multi-omics Approaches to Human Disease Practical sessions The practical and associated exercises provide an understanding of both basic and advanced contemporary molecular methods that are applicable to the detection of genetic mutations that cause human disease. It will give each student practical laboratory experience of a selection of contemporary molecular methods and provide an appreciation of the advantages and disadvantages of basic molecular approaches used in molecular diagnostics and research. Due to large size of class the practical sessions are run in 2 groups - Group A (weeks 1-4) and Group B (weeks 5-8). Practical Session 1: Isolation of Nucleic acids from clinical samples (blood). Analysis of nucleic acids by agarose gel electrophoresis. Practical Session 2: PCR amplification of a 391 bp region of exon 5 of the MTHFR gene using an exon-5 specific sense primer and an intronic antisense primer. Practical Session 3: Set up 3 methods for genotyping clinical samples - RFLP, Allele- specific PCR and DNA sequencing. Practical Session 4: Analysis of genotyping results. Practical Session 5: Tutorial session on 1) Use of bioinformatic tools to design an PCR- RFLP assay to detect a given mutation; 2) writing a Scientific Paper for a peer-reviewed journal. Module content is designed to align with SDG 3 by providing students with an understanding of how genetics can be utilised to promote well-being and to aid in our understanding of transmission of inherited disease through a family; that cancer is a genetic disease; the likely response of an individual to therapeutic drugs: how mutations in DNA alter the proteins produced; and the multiple levels at which gene expression is controlled. SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. Finally, the module also aligns with SDG 5, 8 and 9. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Lectures will be provided by specialists in the specific subject areas. At the start of Practical session discussions will be held to identify the key objectives and learning outcomes for that specific session.Tutorials will be held", "extract": "the main Biomedical

SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. Finally, the module also aligns with SDG 5, 8 and 9. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Lectures will be provided by specialists in the specific subject areas. At the start of Practical session discussions will be held to identify the key objectives and learning outcomes for that specific session.Tutorials will be held during the module to clarify student queries on specific genetic topics. The Practical sessions will address specific learning objectives. Students will be directed to read specific practical notes and instructions, recommended texts and a small selection of key published scientific papers. Students will be expected to acquire an appreciation of clinical genetics, basic and contemporary advances that impact on clinical diagnostics. The module is delivered by hybrid learning. The online module area will be separated into folders containing learning materials, instructions and relevant information for the practical course, and coursework assignments. Each folder will contain lecture notes and additional reading material. A module hand-out and results from each practical will be provided in appropriate web-based folders. Students are encouraged to email members of the teaching staff with questions about coursework. Answers to these questions are sent out to all students. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Practical skills assessment [50%] Genetics Practical Portfolio Students will develop the skills to design and implement a DNA-based test for a genetic disorder. Students will use bioinformatic programs to design PCR primers to amplify a particular region of the human genome containing a disease-causing mutation. They will then investigate whether this can be detected using restriction enzymes. Each student will be marked individually on this part of the assessment (10% - equivalent to 400 words) Students will be given the materials required to PCR amplify a particular region of the human genome and to use and compare a variety of techniques (Restriction digest, allele- specific PCR and DNA sequencing) to detect mutations on a given gene. Based on the practical skills acquired during the practical course, students will be given data from a population-wide genetic screen and asked to prepare a suitably formatted scientific paper. This will be written and assessed individually (40% - 1600 words - but includes statistical analysis of results provided) 2000 total word count equivalancy Written examination [50%] The written examination (2 hours duration) will contribute 50% to the overall module mark. The closed book examination paper will be divided into three Sections. Section A (22% of the marks) will comprise 22 MCQs to cover the entire course (all questions must be answered), Sections B and C (each worth 39% of the marks) will consist of short-answer questions to cover the entire course (students must answer 3 from a choice of 5 from each section). Within this module assessment will take the form of a practical skills assessment (50%) and a written examination (50%). Both elements must meet the threshold standard of 40% for the module to be passed. The practical skills assessment must be passed as a whole, not each individual component. Within this module feedback will take the form of: Introduction of learning objectives in the module and each class by the Module Coordinator / Lecturer Discussions and debates within the lectures, tutorial classes and practical classes Help, advice and comments in practical classes by lecturers, tutors and/or demonstrators Specific verbal comments on student work to help indicate progress and develop student understanding Guidance and advice on academic progress from assigned Studies Advisor(s) and other staff. Feedback will be provided within 20 working days 50% Coursework 50% Examination READING LIST Required: Tom Strachan & Andrew Read 2019 Human Molecular Genetics 5th Edition Boca Raton, Florida, CRC Press Recommended: Krebs, Jocelyn E., Goldstein, Elliott S., Kilpatrick, Stephen 2021 Lewin's Essential GENES 4th Edition, Burlington MA, USA Jones & Bartlett Publishers SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module considers genetic defects that contribute to human disease with study of recombinant DNA techniques, human inheritance, chromosomal aberrancies and inborn errors of metabolism, carcinogenesis and ageing. Practical experience of contemporary molecular biological techniques is also provided. Advances in molecular genetics and multi- omics are also discussed and provide an appreciation of the potential for improved diagnostics and therapeutics RATIONALE Microbiology is a fundamental part of the biological system and constitutes three of the main Kingdom systems of living organisms. It is therefore essential that all Biomedical and Life Science Graduates become familiar with the unseen part of the Biota and its characteristics, impact on the environment and human, animal and plant health. AIMS To recognise the various types of microorganisms (Bacteria, Fungi, Viruses, protozoa and micro-algae), their importance, role in nature and main historical developments in the field. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Become aware of the microbial world, differentiate between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells, know the important physiological processes within microorganisms and their genetic traits. Describe some of the techniques employed in propagating, monitoring and elimination of microorganisms and appreciate the microbial diversity and role microorganisms play in the environment. Describe the chemical nature of genetic material and flow of information on the cellular level and way of altering and control mechanisms within microbial cells; Outline the importance of microorganisms in the medical, public health, food, biotechnological and research fields using specific examples in each area.

LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS This module is delivered through a series of lectures supported by practical classes. Lecture material is supported by the core text and students have the opportunity to engage in independent learning through coursework and practicals and tutorials hours. Lecture notes and other relevant course material is available on a dedicated Blackboard site with links to relevant academic and commercial sites. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written examination [50%] Written final examination There will be 1 2 hour examination. It will be divided into three parts: Section A 40 MCQ/ short answer questions (40% of the exam mark) All topics covered in lectures will be represented by this batch of questions and there will be no choice. Section B A question involving experimental design and calculations (10 % of exam mark). Section C A choice of three from six essay style examination questions (50% of the exam mark). A minimum score of 40% is required for passing this component. Practical skills assessment [50%] Practical Notebooks: Submission of practical workbook covering experimental design and interpretation as well as calculations of relevance to microbiology and reporting of observations, contamination levels, patterns of microbial growth, maintaining sanitary conditions and disinfection. This activity will be completed during the practical sessions contributes 20% to the total mark for the module. The practical element is a professional recognition requirement. In weeks 5 and 9, students will complete the coursework with MCQs and fill in the space type of questions (25 minutes). Feedback is given within 20 working days of the CA maximum. Feedback will come in many different forms and channels. It is important that students pay attention to the oral feedback and comments they are receiving in and out of class, and written feedback provided on assignments and other work. Students will be regularly reminded to be mindful of the feedback offered to them. \u2022Within this module feedback will take the form of: Introduction of learning objectives for the module and specific objectives for each of the lecture classes. This will be delivered by Module Co-Ordinator and individual lecturers as appropriate. \u2022General comments made in lectures/tutorials/seminars (e.g. discussion and debate in-class or online).

A major goal is to provide a foundation for understanding and learning microbiology as a biological science and its relation to our public health and the environment. MODULE TITLE Diploma in International Academic Studies MODULE CODE BMS320 EFFECTIVE FROM September 2024 MODULE LEVEL 5 CREDIT POINTS 120 MODULE INSTANCE(S) RATIONALE An international perspective and an appreciation of cultural, social and economic issues are desirable qualities in an Ulster graduate. The purpose of this module is to provide undergraduate students with an opportunity to develop these qualities by undertaking an extended period of study with a partner institution outside United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. The study abroad normally takes place in Year 3 and for an approved period of study. The study abroad opportunity should significantly support the development of graduates who are equipped to compete in the global labour market, and act as global ambassadors for Ulster University. AIMS This module aims to support an internationally relevant curriculum through delivering a transformative international experience for students. The experience will equip students with the capacity to recognise multiple perspectives, to collaborate across cultures and be", "extract": "role microorganisms play in the environment.

graduate. The purpose of this module is to provide undergraduate students with an opportunity to develop these qualities by undertaking an extended period of study with a partner institution outside United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. The study abroad normally takes place in Year 3 and for an approved period of study. The study abroad opportunity should significantly support the development of graduates who are equipped to compete in the global labour market, and act as global ambassadors for Ulster University. AIMS This module aims to support an internationally relevant curriculum through delivering a transformative international experience for students. The experience will equip students with the capacity to recognise multiple perspectives, to collaborate across cultures and be able to engage effectively with diverse audiences. Such global competence will equip students with the capacity to understand and act on issues of global significance, utilising skills, understanding and confidence to live, work and study in international contexts. Engagement with the module will enhance students understanding of their academic discipline whilst absorbing experiences gained within another cultural and educational environment LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Demonstrate increased awareness of how their discipline may be applied through study of ideas, contexts and frameworks in the different cultural and educational environment. Research new information and/or explore new or existing data to identify patterns and relationships that transfer knowledge and understanding from one environment to the other. Critically reflect on the cultural and educational learning experience and develop reflexive capacity to enable self-development in the context of career decision making. Adapt interpersonal and communication skills to a range of new situations, audiences and degrees of complexity, communicating effectively using appropriate written, verbal, or digital delivery methods. CONTENT While the precise nature of each study abroad option will vary, students will normally spend an approved period studying at a host institution where they: Complete an agreed number of credits as specified for the study abroad option. These must be equivalent to the undergraduate credit load of the host institution. For programmes within Europe, students must complete 60 ECTS across the academic year. For programmes outside of Europe, please confirm the necessary credit load with the Global Engagement Office: goglobal@ulster.ac.uk LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Study abroad and pre-departure information sessions containing individual and group exercises, help students explore and anticipate potential personal and professional development. Lectures and seminars at host institutions inform students about the international dimension of their academic discipline whilst absorbing wider experiences. Recording and updating learning through reflective practices gives students the opportunity to document their learning, their goals and aspirations and their plans. Undertaking a home institution defined student project gives students the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills they have gained in their study to an extended individual piece of work. Live presentations provide opportunity for students to demonstrate ability to draw on and contrast experiences from local and international cultures and environments. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Dissertation [50%] During the placement year, each student will undertake a scientific project or a business / management topic (BEI students) in the context of the country where the work is conducted. All students are advised of the content of the required dissertation. The proposed title and pr\u00e9cis of the proposed work must be submitted by 1st March of the placement year. The dissertation also contains a reflective learning log of activities during the placement as well as evidence of academic and personal development and achievement: Areas of importance are: analytical skills learned during the placement experience; evaluation of competencies with respect to a future career in light of the eight skill areas which employers have identified as the key attributes sought in graduates - willingness to learn, flexibility, dependability, self-motivation, team work, co-operation, oral and written communication skills. Academic Transcript [50%] This is based on a satisfactory report from the Training and Employment Agency (in the case of students undertaking the BEI programme in the US), which includes a transcript of the module results from the US University. In the case of the SOCRATES/ERASMUS programmes, a Supervisor's Report, together with - where applicable - the results of modules undertaken. Full details of what is required for each element of the linked pieces of assessment will be provided in the module handbook. To be eligible for the award of DIPLOMA IN INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC STUDIES (DIAS) candidates must have achieved an overall mark of at least 40% in the assessment requirements for the PLACEMENT YEAR and have successfully completed the associated degree.

Clinical placement in year 3 of the programme in an approved NHS Pathology or Agency laboratory, providing the student with training and support to facilitate successful completion of the Certificate of Competence portfolio. Students are eligible for Health & Care Professions Council (HCPC) registration as a Biomedical Scientist and licentiate membership of the IBMS, following successful completion and award of the Certificate of Competence portfolio and the BSc Hons Applied Biomedical Science DPP (Pathology) degree programme. Placement may be uni-discipline or multidisciplinary (The core disciplines as defined by the IBMS are as follows: Clinical Biochemistry; Cellular Pathology (Histology and Cytology and/or Molecular Pathology); Haematology; Immunology; Medical Microbiology; Transfusion Science; and Virology). AIMS To provide training of sufficient rigor to complete the IBMS Certificate of Competence portfolio; to develop a learner's ability in teamwork, problem solving, decision making, initiative and creativity; to enhance learner's awareness of the work environment in both professional and social contexts; to direct students attention in assessing and developing a career focus. Successful completion of both the placement year and accredited degree programme will allow completion of the IBMS Certificate of Competence. Upon graduation from the programme, the nature of the integrated degree, i.e. a degree that consists of a programme of integrated education and training, enables students to apply for registration with the HCPC. Registration with the HCPC allows graduates to apply immediately for Biomedical Scientist positions within the National Health Service (NHS). LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Consolidate knowledge and skills acquired during their studies and appreciate employer standards and levels of performance, being able to evaluate actions, methods, and results accurately Demonstrate a structured, practical experience of the diagnostic laboratory, refine, and use practical, conceptual, or technological understanding to create ways forward Initiate and lead tasks and processes, taking responsibility for work of others, exercising broad autonomy and judgement Successfully complete the appropriate sections of the IBMS Certificate of Competence Portfolio CONTENT Theory: Developing knowledge of biomedical processes and phenomena by way of Certificate of Competence Registration portfolio. Practical: Direct experience of a professional, biomedical laboratory and the associated techniques. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS This is a practical clinical placement where learners consolidate their biomedical practice by working under the supervision of Registered Biomedical Scientists, and then, when considered competent in particular procedures working independently and reporting back to the placement supervisor. While on placement, supervision is provided by a professional, accompanied by visits by an academic member of staff to assess the learners progress and completion of the IBMS Certificate of Competence portfolio. Work-based assessments support and complement the progress of the learner in the completion of their training. During placement, the learners prepare a set of case studies assessed by an academic member of staff. During and on completion of the placement, the learner will reflect on his / her placement experience and present a case study in a seminar. The Placement Supervisor and Academic Tutor will provide a detailed report on the learner. In the course of placement the learner would normally be expected to have accumulated at least 1,000 hours of benchwork. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Portfolio [80%] Part 1 (20%) Presentation Mid Placement Students should present a 5 minute (includes an additional 1 minute discussing the skills that have been acquired during placement) Part 3 (40%) Case Study Portfolio Two case studies (maximum 20 pages each) should be prepared and submitted via the Turnitin submission drop box Part 4 (20%) Case Study Presentation Students should present a 5 minute (includes an additional 1 minute reflecting their time during placement) Performance [20%] Part 2 (10%) Academic Evaluation Report The placement coordinator will meet with each student and evaluate their skills to date. Part 5 (10%) Employer Evaluation Report Sessional examination (Verification) The verification will follow the format outlined below (organised by employer training officer): \u2022Informal Interview with Candidate and Training Officer (15-20 mins) \u2022Portfolio Verification (maximum 90 mins) \u2022Tour of Laboratory (40 mins) \u2022Meeting with Training Officer (15 mins) \u2022Feedback Comments to Trainer and Candidate (15 mins) Full details of what is required for each element of assessment will also be provided in the module handbook. To be eligible for the award of DIPLOMA IN PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE (DPP) learners must have achieved an overall mark of at least 40% in the assessment requirements for the placement year and have successfully completed the associated degree. The results of learners shall be graded by order of merit as Pass with Distinction, Pass with Commendation and Pass. The following shall be the minimum percentages used in determining the overall gradings of candidates: Pass with Distinction 70% Pass with Commendation 60% Pass 40% Learners who fail placement may be required to either repeat the placement year for the award of DPP, transfer to the three year Biomedical Science degree programme or withdraw from the course. Feedback Each assessment is accompanied by a specific rubric spreadsheet containing a section for comments. Within this section, students will receive both a grade and feedback. 100% Coursework 0% Examination READING LIST Recommended: Library Databases and Websites which will be used routinely with each class \u2022The Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS): http://www.ibms.org \u2022Health Care professions Council (HCPC) http://www.hcpc-uk.co.uk \u2022The Royal College of Pathologists: https://www.rcpath.org/ \u2022IBMS Student Hub Session 2023: https://www.ibms.org/resources/ibms-support-hubs-2023/ \u2022IBMS Student Hub Session 2024: file:///C:/Users/e10075063/Downloads/poster-support- hubs-updated-digital-version-june-23-compressed%20(3).pdf \u2022Vevox https://www.vevox.com/ Books/Journal Article/Publications Useful books but not required Ahmed N, Glencross H and Wang Q (2022) Biomedical Science Practice (Experimental and Professional Skills) ISBN: 9780198717317. 512 Useful Journals The Biomedical Scientist: https://www.ibms.org/resources/journals/the-biomedical-scientist/ Pathology of practice: https://www.pathologyinpractice.com/ SUMMARY DESCRIPTION A 48 week Clinical placement in year 3 of the programme in an approved NHS Pathology or Agency laboratory, providing the learner with training and support to facilitate successful completion of the registration portfolio.

programme in an approved NHS Pathology or Agency laboratory, providing the learner with training and support to facilitate successful completion of the registration portfolio. Learners will be eligible to apply for HCPC registration as a Biomedical Scientist and licentiate membership of the IBMS, following successful completion of the IBMS Certificate of Competence portfolio and the degree programme. RATIONALE This module covers core principles of pathophysiology in order to provide students with a fundamental understanding of disease mechanisms and pathology of body systems. AIMS To introduce key principles in general and systematic pathology sufficient to underpin further study in the biomedical sciences. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Discuss the basis of changes that occur in tissues and body systems in pathological conditions. Describe, the signs and symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of important pathologies and how they alter normal homeostatic functioning of the human body. Discuss the role of pathology in the investigation of disease in general. Assemble and develop information detailing a pathological disease. CONTENT Lectures Pathological Principles: Pathology, health and disease, cell growth and adaptation, cell injury and death, inflammation, wound healing and repair. General Pathology: general principles of laboratory medicine, cell growth, adaptation, injury and death, ischaemia, infarction and shock, carcinogenesis and neoplasia. Inflammation and tissue damage, carcinogenesis and neoplasia. Systemic Pathology: pathology of the nervous system, pathology of the musculoskeletal system, pathology of the cardiovascular system, pathology of the respiratory system, pathology of the endocrine system, pathology of the reproductive system, pathology of the gastrointestinal system, pathology of the kidney/urinary tract. Practical (Case studies) will be based on diseases associated with the body systems: pathology of the nervous system, pathology of the musculoskeletal system, pathology of the cardiovascular system, pathology of the respiratory system, pathology of the endocrine system, pathology of the reproductive system, pathology of the gastrointestinal system, pathology of the kidney/urinary tract. The content is designed with cross-referencing of material throughout, meaning the students will view these topics as a comprehensive and holistic overview of Pathophysiology, rather than individuals topics. Module content is designed to align with SDG 3 by providing students with an understanding of pathophysiology to promote well-being and to aid in how the understanding of pathophysiology can used to improve health. SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Teaching will be in the form of lectures practical classes and tutorials. The lectures will contain content which will provide students with an understanding of key concepts in pathophysiology. The practical classes will allow students to address cases on specific diseases, thereby putting knowledge gathered in lectures into practice. Tutorials will support revision activities. The module is supported by extensive learning materials placed within the Virtual Learning Environment Blackboard Learn, which students can access using their allocated login and password details. These include self-assessment quizzes, case studies, publications and relevant web-links to assist in their studies. Students are expected to engage with these materials in order to maximise their learning experience. In addition, independent learning will be required through the use of directed reading and students will be encouraged to broaden their knowledge by utilising a variety of learning resources.

SDGs: SDG3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG4 (Quality Education). AIMS To develop key principles in general and systematic pathology for study in the biomedical sciences. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Discuss the manifestation, diagnosis and treatment of important pathologies and how they alter normal homeostatic functioning of the human body. Discuss and critically evaluate the pathogenesis of disease progression. Discuss and critically analyse information detailing disease pathologies. Engage in independent learning using IT and communicate this effectively in written and oral forms CONTENT Pathological Principles: Pathology, health and disease, cell growth and adaptation, cell injury and death, inflammation, wound healing and repair. General Pathology: general principles of laboratory medicine, cell growth, adaptation, injury and death, ischaemia, infarction and shock, carcinogenesis and neoplasia. Inflammation and tissue damage, carcinogenesis and neoplasia. Systemic Pathology: pathology of the nervous system, pathology of the musculoskeletal system, pathology of the cardiovascular system, pathology of the respiratory system, pathology of the endocrine system, pathology of the reproductive system, pathology of the gastrointestinal system, pathology of the kidney/urinary tract The content is designed with cross-referencing of material throughout, meaning the students will view these topics as a comprehensive and holistic overview of pathobiology, rather than individuals topics. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Teaching will be in the form of lectures. In addition, independent learning will be required through the use of directed reading and students will be encouraged to broaden their knowledge by utilising a variety of learning resources. Learning materials for the module will be provided within the Virtual Learning Environment Blackboard Learn, which students can access using their allocated login and password details. The module will be taught by lectures and individual study. Students will have access to online support, including self- assessment quizzes, case studies, publications and relevant web-links to assist in their studies. They will also have access to an e-tutor for guidance and support. The module is offered fully online. Journal-Based Learning and Case Studies will be based on diseases associated with the body systems: pathology of the nervous system, pathology of the musculoskeletal system, pathology of the cardiovascular system, pathology of the respiratory system, pathology of the endocrine system, pathology of the reproductive system, pathology of the gastrointestinal system and pathology of the kidney/urinary tract. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written assignment [40%] Journal-Based Learning These assignments will enable students to research pathophysiological diseases. Students are given four reviews of diseases and have to answer 10 true or false questions on each review. Journal-Based Learning will contribute 40% of the module mark. A minimum of 40% is required to pass this part of the assessment. The assessment is accompanied by a specific rubric spreadsheet containing a section for comments. Within this section, students will receive both a grade and feedback. The total equivalent word count for the four reviews is 400. Report [60%] Case Study Reports Two Case Study Reports (800 words each) to assess understanding of the application of pathophysiological diseases in the patient context. Case Study Reports will contribute 30% each, 60% of the module mark. A minimum of 40% is required to pass this part of the assessment. Each assessment is accompanied by a specific rubric spreadsheet containing a section for comments. Within this section, students will receive both a grade and feedback.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module develops core principles of professional practice in Healthcare Science. MODULE TITLE Placement: Diploma in Professional Practice MODULE CODE BMS504 EFFECTIVE FROM September 2024 MODULE LEVEL 5 CREDIT POINTS 60 MODULE INSTANCE(S) RATIONALE The purpose of this module is to provide undergraduate students with an opportunity to gain structured and professional work experience, in a work-based learning environment, as part of their planned programme of study at the University. This experience allows students to develop, refine and reflect on their key personal and professional skills. The placement normally takes place in Year 3 and is normally for a minimum duration of 26 weeks work- based learning. The placement opportunity should significantly support the development of the student's employability skills, preparation for final year and enhance their employability journey. AIMS To allow students to apply subject specific academic knowledge and learning in practical and professional situations. To provide students with an opportunity to develop practical, subject specific work experience in a relevant organisation. To promote student awareness of the work environment in both a professional and social context. To develop and consolidate personal, professional and/or employability skills relevant to, and required for, the graduate labour market. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Solve work-based problems underpinned by subject specific related theory and contribute to the employer organisation Demonstrate professional standards, ethics and etiquette in collaborative work environments. Critically reflect on the professional learning experience and self-development in the context of career decision making. Communicate effectively to a variety of audiences using appropriate written, verbal, or digital delivery methods. CONTENT While the precise nature of placement will vary considerably, students will normally gain experience in some of the following areas: practical laboratory work, project management, specialised life sciences research techniques, report writing, presentations, professional experience and development of interpersonal skills. This will be specific to each placement provider. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS During placement each student will be supervised by an Employer Supervisor from the organisation and supported by an Academic Supervisor from their School. The supervision of students on placement is a shared responsibility between the Placement Coordinator, Academic Supervisor and Employer Supervisor. Initially students will have close supervision and guidance but are progressively given more personal responsibility as the placement proceeds. Students will be expected to engage with their placement organisation's policies and strategic documents to familiarise themselves to their professional setting. Students are expected to be proactive in identifying their learning needs and should plan to meet these in line with the learning outcomes of this module and any organisational identified needs. Students will be directed to read from the required and recommended reading lists and identify their own sources of additional reading. An Academic Supervisor will normally make structured contact on a minimum of two occasions across the placement, once in Semester 1 and again in Semester 2, either face to face or using telephone/Skype/remote meeting technology. The module is offered by blended learning. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Practical skills assessment [40%] During placement, the academic supervisor completes a report based upon student performance during placement visits (20% of marks). At the end of placement, a report is completed by the student's industrial supervisor which assesses the progress of the student against specified criteria (20% of marks);", "extract": "reflective practice in the context of Biomedical Science.

This experience allows students to develop, refine and reflect on their key personal and professional skills. The placement should significantly support the development of the student's employability skills, preparation for final year and enhance their employability journey. RATIONALE This module provides students with an opportunity to undertake an independent investigation in an area of biomedical/biosciences. The module provides experience in project planning and methodology by relevant literature survey, data collection/handling/analysis, and interpretation, thereby developing a range of research and transferable skills. AIMS This module will provide students with an opportunity to perform an independent, supervised, relevant, in-depth investigation of a specific topic in the field of biomedical/biosciences. The investigative project will include: comprehensive review of the scientific literature; planning and methodology; analysing and critically evaluating data; writing a dissertation; and presenting and defending the work. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Critically review scientific literature, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and knowledge gaps and demonstrate critical understanding of research methods and statistical tests. Understand the limitations and impact of research and enquiry-based learning in the advancement of biomedical/bioscience disciplines and their wider application. Engage in an appropriate and relevant investigative topic in the biomedical/ biosciences and Analyse and interpret the outcomes of an investigative study. Produce a structured report on their investigative project and deliver an effective presentation on their investigative project. CONTENT Lectures, tutorials, and practical sessions will focus on project planning, data handling and analysis, and effective scientific communication, in order to directly inform the assessed components of this module. Indicative content: Semester 1: Weeks 1-4: Scientific communication: Introduction to essential communication skills (planning, writing, reflecting and revising); recording and managing information; ethical considerations in scientific communication; conducting effective literature searches (tools and search functions); critically reviewing scientific literature; writing a literature review (searching, evaluating, synthesising, writing, reflecting, revising); writing a scientific and lay abstract; writing a research paper and a dissertation; delivering an oral and/or poster presentation (planning, preparing, practising, delivering, defending and self-evaluation); developing networking opportunities. Semester 1: Weeks 5-8: Planning: Role of research in advancing knowledge in biomedical/biosciences; experimental designs - types, suitability and limitations; hypothesis formulation and testing; benefits and limitations of research involving human participants or animals; considerations of ethical approvals for projects involving human participants and animals. Semester 1: Weeks 9-12: Quantitative research methods including data handling and analysis: Quantitative and qualitative data; obtaining and verifying data; presenting data in graphical and/or tabular form; audit, quality and good laboratory practice; nature of probability and significance; probability distributions; confidence intervals; parametric testing - t-test, analysis of variance, analysis of covariance; non-parametric tests; statistical power and sample size calculations; partial correlation; analysis of large data sets - multiple regression; critical evaluation of statistical results in published scientific literature. Commercialisation of biomedical/biosciences research (innovation, technology transfer and managing intellectual property in bio-business. Semester 2: The lecture and preparatory content will be completed in Semester 1 and during Semester 2 students will be fully engaged in delivering and reporting on their investigative projects. The number of hours to be spent on project work in the laboratory, or on analysis of data in \"dry\" projects will be largely dependent upon the nature of the project undertaken. No set hours are specified for either lab work or independent study but it is expected that students will enter the lab to progress their project on a daily basis in semester 2.

"chunk-89", "title": "Section 90", "text": "Semester 2: The lecture and preparatory content will be completed in Semester 1 and during Semester 2 students will be fully engaged in delivering and reporting on their investigative projects. The number of hours to be spent on project work in the laboratory, or on analysis of data in \"dry\" projects will be largely dependent upon the nature of the project undertaken. No set hours are specified for either lab work or independent study but it is expected that students will enter the lab to progress their project on a daily basis in semester 2. SGDs The content for this module is designed to align with SDG 4 by providing students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. SDG 3 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with an understanding of good health and wellbeing in the context of current thinking in biomedical sciences research. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Semester 1 Lectures will be used to underpin development of students' knowledge and appreciation of concepts and techniques important to successfully execute an independent investigative project. Small group tutorials will be used to demonstrate use of online database searching tools, develop familiarity with original research and review papers, and gain 'hands on' experience of reading, extracting and integrating relevant information and evaluating scientific literature. Individual tutorials with project supervisors will advise students on their project plan, scope and direction of the literature review. Practical computer-based sessions will develop skills in data manipulation, interpretation and critical evaluation, complement lectures using appropriate programmes such as SPSS. Students will be directed to read selected sections of relevant book chapters, reviews and research papers. Students are expected to selectively search databases in their chosen topic and to identify relevant information for synthesis. Learning and teaching materials will be provided through BBLearn and on-line support will be available. The number of hours to be spent on project work in the laboratory, or on analysis of data in \"dry\" projects will be largely dependent upon the nature of the project undertaken. No set hours are specified for either lab work or independent study but it is expected that students will enter the lab to progress their project on a daily basis in semester 2. This module is offered by hybrid learning. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written assignment [20%] Coursework 1: Class Test (Data Analysis) Data analysis class test assignment (1 h), based upon lecture material delivered in Weeks 9-12 of Sem1 will be set. This will be completed in the computer class session in wk12 of Sem1 and comprises 20% of the module mark . Dissertation [80%] Coursework 2: Dissertation In Semester 2, each student must submit the outcome(s) of their investigative project in the form of a structured dissertation. The dissertation will be presented according to clearly defined criteria provided to the student, but will broadly contain the following sections: (i) abstract/summary, including in addition a lay summary, and a visual abstract; (ii) introduction (literature review); (iii) methodology; (iv) results/discussion; and (v) bibliography. The Dissertation should explicitly follow guidelines provided to each student and should be confined to no more than 50 single-sided A4 pages of text. There will be two assigned markers who will assess using criteria clearly defined in the assessment sheet which will include written communication skills (55%). Prior to submission of their dissertation, each student will prepare and deliver a short poster presentation with oral defence based on outcomes of their investigative project. Using clearly defined guidelines and assessment criteria, the student will present their poster to two assessors followed by questions and discussion. Each student will be provided with instant oral feedback and subsequent written feedback on their presentation. This feedback should help inform final preparation of the dissertation (15%). Following submission of the dissertation, the Project Supervisor will assess their student's professionalism and performance. This assessment will take into account all aspects of the preparation and execution of the project. Professionalism and Performance Report will contribute 10% of the module mark. Dissertation and poster, and supervisor's assessment will will contribute 80% of the module mark. (8000 words) Assessment is via a class test on statistical analysis (CA1, 20%) which will underpin the practical/data analysis element of the project. The remainder of the assessment comprises three components - a dissertation describing background to, and project work undertaken, a poster presentation/oral defence of the work undertaken, and a supervisor's report on student laboratory performance (CA2, 80%). Within this module feedback will take the form of: Introduction of learning objectives by either Module Coordinator or Lecturer. Discussions and debates within lectures, tutorial and practical classes. Help, advice and comments in classes by lecturers and/or tutors. Specific verbal comments on student work (including feedback on dissertation and poster drafts ) to help indicate progress and develop student understanding. Guidance and advice on academic progress from assigned Studies Advisor(s) and other staff including project supervisor 100% Coursework 0% Examination READING LIST Recommended: Appropriate scientific journals as dictated by the nature of the Investigative Project. SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This Investigative Project is an independent piece of work completed by the student, designed to develop key research and transferable skills in a discipline relevant to biomedical sciences/biosciences. RATIONALE This module extends earlier introduced core material in genetics and introduces specialised topics on recent advances and current considerations in the field. SDG3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG4 (Quality Education) SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). AIMS To deepen knowledge and understanding of key areas of genetics, its relevance to 'stratified medicine' and facilitate an introductory appreciation of recent specialised developments and current considerations in human and molecular genetics. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Consolidate and apply a detailed and comprehensive knowledge of the structure/composition of the human genome, the regulation of gene expression, and genetic basis for disease. Evaluate the application of information obtained from genome projects and its implications to research and medicine. Develop skills in searching public databases and applying contemporary", "extract": "Semester 2: The lecture and preparatory content will be completed in Semester 1 and during Semester 2 students will be fully engaged in delivering and reporting on their investigative projects. The number of hours to be spent on project work in the laboratory, or on analysis of data in \"dry\" projects will be largely dependent upon the nature of the project undertaken.", "vector":

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION The module considers in depth, key areas of genetics and introduces specialised topics based on recent advances and current considerations in the human and molecular genetics field. The application of available genomic/SNP data towards stratified and personalised medicine will be discussed. MODULE TITLE Clinical Immunology & Medical Microbiology MODULE CODE BMS508 EFFECTIVE FROM January 2025 MODULE LEVEL 6 CREDIT POINTS 20 MODULE INSTANCE(S) RATIONALE This module provides an overview of some current thinking in the field of infectious disease by considering the interaction of host (immunology) and pathogen (microbiology). It allows students to appreciate the range of tools needed to diagnose infection and monitor the epidemiology of pathogens as a strategy to control infectious disease. The module places significant emphasis on appreciating how an understanding of the regulation of the immune response can explain the interaction between host and pathogen at the molecular level. A significant element of the module considers how this information can be used to develop new approaches to diagnosis, therapy and disease prevention for both infectious and non- infectious diseases. AIMS To provide students with an advanced understanding of host-pathogen interactions in infectious disease. To enable students to appreciate the contribution of studies of pathogen virulence mechanisms to improvements in: diagnostic tools, vaccines and the development of novel therapeutics. To enable students to appreciate the need for understanding the role of the immune system in the pathology of both infectious and non-infectious diseases. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Critically evaluate the application of cutting edge research techniques to facilitate greater understanding the pathogenicity of infectious disease. Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of laboratory systems used to diagnose infectious disease and appreciate how these are employed to monitor epidemics. Source and critically analyse primary research literature to supplement lecture material in the areas of infectious disease and host response. Understand and appreciate current infections of concern in the context of: pathogen biology, disease emergence and systems of control.

"text": "need for understanding the role of the immune system in the pathology of both infectious and non-infectious diseases. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Critically evaluate the application of cutting edge research techniques to facilitate greater understanding the pathogenicity of infectious disease. Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of laboratory systems used to diagnose infectious disease and appreciate how these are employed to monitor epidemics. Source and critically analyse primary research literature to supplement lecture material in the areas of infectious disease and host response. Understand and appreciate current infections of concern in the context of: pathogen biology, disease emergence and systems of control. CONTENT Diagnosis and Epidemiology of infectious disease: Culture based and Molecular methods for pathogen detection; Microbial typing schemes and their application to control of infection. Public health and clinical microbiology. Measurement of pathogenic mechanisms in laboratory systems: Revised Koch's postulates; Genomic strategies in the study of pathogenesis. Development of anti-virulence treatments. Mechanisms of Microbial Pathogenesis: Attachment, Invasion and dissemination, Mechanisms to avoid complement and phagocytosis; Antigenic Variation & Immune system interactions. Molecular mechanisms of Direct Damage and Indirect Damage, activity of microbial toxins. Immunology: mechanisms of inflammation, mechanisms of innate immunity e.g. detection of microbial polymers (PAMPs), control of immunological processes and consequences of control failures e.g. hypersensitivity and autoimmunity. Overview of specific system infections: e.g. Respiratory Tract, Gastrointestinal Tract, Sexually transmitted diseases etc. Vaccines: advantages and disadvantages of different vaccine production strategies (live vaccines, killed vaccines, subcellular vaccines, recombinant vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines) SDGs The content for this module is designed to align with SDG 3 by providing students with an understanding of good health and wellbeing in the context of current thinking in microbiology and immunology. SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. Finally, the module also aligns with SDG 5, 6, and 13 from a microbiological and public health perspective. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Delivery is composed primarily of lectures supported by themed tutorials. Participation in this module is primarily based around acquiring advanced knowledge in selected areas. Advice is given by individual teaching staff on specific required texts and recommended reading. Students are provided with a text book reading list and, where appropriate, directed to sources of additional reading in the current research literature. Through the lectures there is an opportunity to process information and critically reflect on current thinking in the area of infectious disease. The module learning outcomes are supported by the use of continuous assessment which is designed to promote a broad knowledge base of all the topics presented. This is basis from which students can demonstrate their critical thinking in a series of focussed, essay style questions in a final examination. Each member of the teaching team provides a tutorial to underpin the material delivered in lectures and answer student queries. This module is offered by hybrid learning. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Class Test [30%] One Class Test comprising 20 short answer questions/multiple choice questions will be split over two days. Each test will last for 1 hour. Test 1 will be delivered in week 6 and will cover material presented in lectures in weeks 1-5. Test 2 will be delivered in week 11 and will cover material presented in lectures in weeks 6- 10. The questions will be designed to test student understanding of the lecture topics and will cover all topics presented. Written examination [70%] Sessional examination will consist of one x 3 hour paper. The paper will consist of four sections each representing a major subject area delivered in lectures. Students have to attempt one essay/structured question from each section. There will be a choice of two questions in each section Regular formative assessment opportunities, primarily online self-test quizzes, are offered throughout the module and students are strongly encouraged to engage with all formative assessment exercises in order to self-evaluate personal progress with learning. Summative assessment of this module is through Coursework (30%) and a Sessional Examination (70%). The coursework is designed to support students developing a broad knowledge base across the different topics presented in the module. It takes the form of online tests using a mixture of multiple choice questions, \"fill in the blank\" questions and similar short format questions. The written examination is essay based and allows students to demonstrate both their essential knowledge and critical thinking across all elements of the module. Students are directed in lectures to read specified additional materials and to integrate this with the material presented in class. This is tested by setting essay titles that require critical discussion of topics and students are made aware that this necessitates both a high level of detail in examples and, for the highest grades, evidence of independent research. Details of summary marking standards for mark bands/grades, etc. will be given and the rationale underlying them discussed in class. Students will be encouraged to be vigilant with regards avoiding plagiarism in submitted work. Feedback will come in many different forms and channels. It is important that students pay attention to the oral feedback and comments they are receiving in and out of class, and written feedback provided on assignments and other work. Students will be regularly reminded to be mindful of the feedback offered to them. Within this module feedback will take the form of: Introduction of learning objectives for the module and specific objectives for each of the lectures classes. This will be delivered by Module Co-Ordinator and individual lecturers as appropriate. General comments made in lectures/tutorials/seminars (e.g. discussion and debate - in- class or online). Tips on how to best approach assignment(s) and examination(s) to maximize student learning and performance. Help, advice, and comments by lecturers including specific verbal comments about work, progress, and performance, in and out of class. Specific written comments on work to help indicate progress and develop understanding. Guidance and advice on academic progress from assigned Studies Advisor and other Staff. 30%", "extract": "need for understanding the role of the immune system in the pathology of both infectious and non-infectious diseases.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module provides a detailed insight into the interaction between a microbial pathogen and its human host. The interaction between micro-organisms and the immune defence mechanism is highlighted along with the consequences of immune disfunction. Consideration is also given to the use of vaccines and public health approaches to avoid and eliminate infection. The module is taught by a combination of lectures and tutorials with selected reading using online supplementary materials strongly encouraged. RATIONALE This module will present an in-depth consideration of pathology, cellular and molecular biology of the major benign and malignant diseases of humans. The module will enable students to integrate practical and theoretical information gained in earlier modules of the degree programme. Current and emerging strategies in disease diagnosis, treatment and monitoring will also be discussed, which will underpin further study in Biomedical Science. SDG3 Good Health and Wellbeing, SDG4 (Quality Education) SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). AIMS To explore molecular mechanisms of selected disease processes. To deepen an understanding and appreciate the clinical relevance of research in molecular pathology. To provide insights into the multidisciplinary nature of the study and treatment of disease. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Integrate information gained throughout the course of study by researching online literature and utilising information technology. Assemble and develop information describing the pathogenesis of disease processes and be able to critically evaluate current models and theories of the molecular basis of pathology and disease. Demonstrate in-depth knowledge and understanding of the molecular processes leading to human disease by means of assessments and examination. Critically discuss how a multidisciplinary approach to the study of human disease can lead to a better understanding of disease processes, better diagnostic tools, and more effective treatment in applied biomedical sciences. CONTENT Lectures Introduction to Molecular Pathology and the cellular basis of disease Cancer biology and the impact of pathological cell growth on human health and disease Tumour formation and metastasis Disease stratification, molecular diagnostics, and therapeutics. Epigenetic mechanisms in disease molecular pathology practice). Molecular Pathology of breast cancer Molecular Pathology of lung disorders including cystic fibrosis and asthma. Molecular Pathology of major gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease and colon cancer Molecular Pathology of Prostate cancer Molecular Pathology of major cardiovascular disorders including hypertension and stroke. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Delivery is composed primarily of lectures and is primarily knowledge based. Advice is given on the required texts, recommended reading and a reading list together with sources of additional reading by individual tutors. Through the lectures there is an opportunity to process information and reflect on the information provided. Each member of the teaching team also provides a tutorial to underpin the material delivered in lectures and answer student queries. Learning materials will be provided through the Virtual Learning Environment Blackboard Learn and on-line support will be available. Students are required to undertake a critical analysis on a research journal. Students discuss the impact of the topic on the given research field and critically evaluate the study design and the research leading up to and after publication of the article, through preparation of a written report. Students also select and present a pertinent biomedical research related disease topic from a range of diseases chosen by the course team. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written examination [70%] This will consist of a 3-hour written examination comprising three sections with three questions in each section. One question must be answered from each Section and all questions carry equal marks.

The module enables students to integrate practical and theoretical information gained in earlier modules. Current and emerging strategies in disease diagnosis, treatment and monitoring are also discussed, which will underpin further study in Biomedical Sciences. RATIONALE This module is designed to provide advanced understanding in molecular aspects of disease. It will focus on contemporary ideas on the aetiology of disease with particular emphasis on the molecular pathogenesis of selected processes. SDGs: SDG3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG4 (Quality Education). AIMS To explore molecular mechanisms of selected disease processes and appreciate the clinical relevance of research in molecular pathology. To provide insights into the multidisciplinary nature of the study and treatment of disease. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Explain how human ageing and other processes influence disease morbidity and mortality. Assemble and develop information describing the pathogenesis of disease processes. Critically evaluate the scientific literature. Communicate effectively and analyse and summarise complex information. CONTENT Lectures Introduction to pathology and the classification of disease. Cancer biology and the impact of cancer on human health. Molecular pathology of major cancers (e.g. colon and prostate cancer). Molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease and stroke. Molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes mellitus. Molecular mechanisms underlying major neuropathologies Molecular mechanisms underlying ageing and age related pathologies. Hot topics (cutting-edge research in current and emerging biomedical areas of clinical relevance including diseases of the Kidney and Urinary Tract, Musculoskeletal system and the reproductive system). LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Delivery is by means of lectures and participation in this module, from preparation to final assessment is primarily knowledge based. Advice is given on the required texts, recommended reading and a reading list together with sources of additional reading by individual tutors. Through the lectures there is an opportunity to process information and reflect on the information provided. Students are required to undertake literature searches and select a pertinent biomedical research paper from a range of articles chosen by the course team. Students discuss the impact of this paper on the given research field and critically evaluate the study design and the research leading up to and after publication of the article, through preparation of a written report. The module is offered fully online. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written assignment [40%] The students must critically evaluate a scientific paper (choice of paper will be given). Students will be provided with assessment criteria for each marking band. Individual feedback will be written and detailed against each criteria as appropriate. The essay is limited to 1000 words. Written feedback is provided, embedded into the documents submitted by the students. Critical Analysis will contribute 40% of the total module mark. Written examination [60%] This will consist of a 2-hour written examination comprising three sections with three questions in each section. One question must be answered from each Section and all questions carry equal marks. The Written Examination will contribute 60% to the overall module mark. Written feedback is provided, embedded in the document submitted by each student. A mark of at least 40% must be achieved in each element of assessment [coursework and examination] in order to pass the module 40% Coursework 60% Examination READING LIST Required: Xiu P (2022) Crash Course: Pathology (5th Revised Edition), Elsevier.

Students will perform routine and specialized haematology techniques, employed in both a diagnostic and/or research laboratory setting. AIMS To introduce key principles of haematology, that provides the student with grounding of knowledge and training suitable for the practice of haematology in a diagnostic setting or for further studies in this field. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Explain the different elements that constitute blood in normal and diseased states, including nature and diagnosis of anaemia, haematological malignancy, coagulation disorders and transfusion-related disorders. Effectively and safely use laboratory equipment in following laboratory procedures to perform practical lab-work. Interpret laboratory data from the investigation of haematological samples and communicate scientific ideas effectively in writing. Manage personal workload and engage in independent learning. CONTENT Lecture Content Blood cell formation; haematopoietic stem cells and growth factors; stem cell transplantation; haematological laboratory techniques The structure and function of the red blood cell: Red cell metabolism; Disorders of red cell metabolism; Red cell membrane disorders Haemoglobin biosynthesis; Haemoglobin function. Nature and diagnosis of anaemias, haemoglobinopathies and thalassaemias Nutritional requirements of blood cell formation; vitamin B12 and folate metabolism; iron metabolism; nutritional disorders resulting in haematological disease; haemolytic anaemias Haemostasis; platelet structure and function; The coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis; Wound repair; Thrombosis and anticoagulant therapy; Inherited and acquired disorders of haemostasis Leukocyte structure and function; haematological malignancies; genetic basis of malignancy; classification, diagnosis and treatment; Human blood groups; Genetics, inheritance, structure and role of red cell antigens; immune mediated destruction of blood cells; blood group antibodies; Ante-natal serology Preparation, storage and use of blood components; selection of appropriate blood components prior to transfusion; adverse effects of blood transfusion; artificial blood Techniques for investigation of disease: mapped against each of topics above and supported by practical session work. History of haematology/transfusion in medical practice, to include key discoveries from scientists with diverse backgrounds, evaluation of the impacts of application/exploitation of biological discoveries and issues in global healthcare affecting access to good quality diagnosis and treatment. Throughout content, illustrative examples will demonstrate issues of sustainability, ethics, health & safety and innovation in haematology, transfusion science and biomedical science as a whole. Practical work Practical work will be performed to demonstrate key concepts in haematology. Examples of suggested practicals are shown below, but others are acceptable dependent on local laboratory arrangements Making blood films and cell counting Red cell osmotic fragility Haemoglobin Testing Blood grouping Testing for Blood Coagulation Through the delivery of this content, the module will therefore exemplify Quality Education practice (UNESCO Sustainability Goal 4) which promotes understanding of good health & well-being (UNESCO Sustainability Goal 3). Emphasis on competencies (knowledge, skills and behaviours) and illustration if innovation and employability opportunities will provide an employability and entrepreneurship focus in biomedical science, thereby aligning with UNESCO Sustainability Goals 8 & 9. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS This module will be delivered by distance learning via the e-Learning Support Unit in Faculty of Life and Health Sciences at University of Ulster. Learning materials for the module will be provided within the Virtual Learning Environment Blackboard Learn, which students can access using their allocated login and password details. The module will be taught by lectures and individual study. The lectures will contain content which will provide students with an understanding of key concepts in haematology. As part of the individual study, the students will undertake practicals which will allow students to perform haematology techniques in a laboratory. Students will have access to online support, including self- assessment quizzes, case studies, publications and relevant web-links to assist in their studies. They will also have access to an e-tutor for guidance and support. Students are expected to engage with these resources in order to maximise their learning experience. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Report [50%] Coursework : Practical Assessment This will assess students on their ability to perform experiments, present & interpret data and write scientific reports. One practical report (~1,500 words) will be submitted electronically using drop-boxes available within the module area. Individual feedback will be written and detailed against each criteria as appropriate. Extra information and guidelines on reports, assessment criteria and submission will be provided in the module area throughout the duration of the module, including exemplars of reports at different mark levels. Coursework will contribute 50% of the module mark. The Coursework will assess Learning Outcomes 2 & 3 Written examination [50%] A 90min paper which comprises a mixture of Multiple Choice Questions, short answer questions and/or essay-type questions. For the latter types of question, students will be provided with assessment rubrics and assessment criteria for each marking band. Total word count for paper is 1,500 words The written examination will contribute 50% to the overall module mark. The examination will assess Learning Outcomes 1 & 4 The procedures used for assessment cover the subject knowledge (breadth and depth), abilities and skills.

SDG3 Good Health and Wellbeing, SDG4 (Quality Education) SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). AIMS To introduce the concepts of clinical biochemistry and its application in the biomedical sciences. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Explain in detail principles and application of the biochemical investigations used in screening, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of disease, discussing the physiological and pathological processes which affect biochemical investigations. Critically discuss the use of clinical biochemistry data in the diagnosis and management of common disorders, using database resources and the internet to access and evaluate information relating to clinical biochemistry. Demonstrate critical analysis skills in the interpretation of clinical biochemistry findings, taking into account the patient history and presentation and being able to suggest appropriate investigations and further follow up. Perform appropriate biochemical tests associated with a clinical biochemistry pathology laboratory and explain in depth the principles of the analytical techniques used in the clinical biochemistry laboratory. CONTENT Online Lectures Lectures are focused on the principles and application of the biochemical investigations used in screening, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of disease with an emphasis on the biochemical investigate of function and dysfunction of organs and systems. Clinical laboratory sample preparation and laboratory automation Kidney function and liver function Water, sodium and potassium and human health Thyroid function and carbohydrate metabolism Hydrogen ion homeostasis and blood gases Hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal and gonad function Gastrointestinal tract and clinical nutrition Calcium, phosphate, magnesium, bone health Plasma proteins, lipids, cardiovascular disease Haemoproteins, porphyrins, iron, malignant disease Toxicology, investigation of substance abuse, therapeutic drug monitoring, malignant disease Practical sessions Practicals have been chosen to illustrate the concepts and pathological conditions discussed in the lectures and to help with understanding of the principles and application of key methodologies used with a clinical biochemistry laboratory. The practicals can be undertaken either in the student's place of work (if they are employed in an appropriate laboratory and have access to the necessary facilities) or at Ulster's Coleraine campus. The practicals are designed to help with developing skills and understanding in the key methodologies that are utilised in the Clinical Biochemistry laboratory. Students can undertake any clinical biochemistry test utilising each of the following core analytical methods: 1. spectrophotometry, 2. turbidimetry/nephelometry/mass spectrophotometry and 3. immunoassay LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS The module is taught by online lectures and practical sessions as well as participation in online clinical case study tutorial discussions within an E-tutor group. Clinical case studies are used where appropriate. Each week there is a folder of teaching material. This contains an online lecture presentation covering the key points along with some compulsory supplementary reading material or videos. There is a resource area for students who need to revise some background concepts to aid their understanding. There is also weekly core reading from the module text books. In addition within the module there is a \"Clinical Conditions Table\" which covers the key clinical chemistry related disorders. Each week, via their independent learning, students have approximately 4-6 conditions to complete within the table. Completion of this Clinical Conditions Table is also used to assist exam revision at the end of the module. Practicals have been chosen to illustrate the concepts and pathological conditions discussed in the lectures and to help with understanding of the principles of key methodologies used with a clinical biochemistry laboratory. The module is offered fully online, except for the practicals which can either be carried during a visit to Coleraine Campus or within an appropriate work place laboratory facility.

MODULE TITLE Pharmacology and Evidence-Based Practice MODULE CODE BMS523 EFFECTIVE FROM October 2024 MODULE LEVEL 6 CREDIT POINTS 20 MODULE INSTANCE(S) RATIONALE This module is designed to familiarize students with core pharmacology in biomedical science, including how drugs act, where they act, how they reach the site of action, how drug actions are terminated, and how such knowledge can be applied to drug selectivity. Furthermore, the module facilitates critical reflection and evaluation of evidence-based best practice highlighted from a pharmacology perspective, in order to further enhance student's research-informed practice and higher skills. AIMS To provide an understanding of pharmacology in a biomedical context including receptors, agonists, antagonists and the interaction and effects of drugs and chemicals on biological systems. The module will develop an understanding of the principles of pharmacology relevant to biomedical science graduate employment including enhancing skills in evidence- based practice. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Demonstrate in-depth knowledge and understanding of applied pharmacology, including the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs (pharmacokinetics), drug targets / actions (pharmacodynamics), drug toxicity, and drug development / regulation. Provide a detailed description of established and emerging topics in systems pharmacology and chemotherapy, including mechanisms of action of a variety of drugs, and their application to treat, manage, and combat disease. Conduct and record systematic literature searches using a range of databases, applying and integrating relevant pharmacological knowledge from a variety of sources. Critically discuss the value of evidence-based practice in biomedical sciences, engaging in independent learning and evaluating scientific literature in a critical manner.

LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS The module encompasses a range of learning and teaching methods including timetabled face to face and on-line classes, coursework, and individual study/independent learning. Due to the numbers taking this module and not large class availability the Evidence Based Practice part of the course will only be available on line where you will be able to access pre-recorded material, Dr Devlin will email you further details. This module will introduce you to the fundamental principles of pharmacology in preparation for careers in clinical and industrial biomedical sciences. Evidence-based practice is integrated within the module using a pharmacological context in which the scientific literature influences or informs introduction of best practice. Lectures will be the major mode of delivery in this module, using PowerPoint presentations supplemented with other learning and support materials. Blackboard Learn (BBLearn) material is accessible via the University Portal, using student username. Students will require a scientific calculator. Students will be directed to a number of specific references for library material and other learning resources in scheduled classes. In addition, students are required, and strongly advised to conduct their own independent reading following guidance from the Tutors delivering the module, which should include consultation of recommended texts and journals. Evidence of further reading on topic areas will be sought within Coursework and the Sessional Examination. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written examination [70%] This will consist of a 3-hour Sessional Examination (SE) paper comprising three Sections. Section A (50% of total mark) will comprise compulsory multiple-choice and/or short-answer questions that will cover the core pharmacology syllabus. Section B (25% of total mark) will comprise unseen structured and/or essay-based questions, where students must answer one question out of a possible four. Section C (25% of total mark) will comprise a compulsory seen question based on student's independent learning of an assigned prescribed drug. The Written Examination will contribute 70% to the overall module mark. Portfolio [30%] A portfolio including the following: The two-part Coursework for this module comprises a class test and an Evidence-Based Practice Case Study. Class test (20%): \u2022 The MCQs quiz will be made available within the Blackboard 'Assessment' area. Feedback Feedback will be provided and discussed in the following week's lecture Evidence-Based Practice Case Study (10%): This assignment will extend students' ability to effectively undertake Evidence-Based Practice (EBP), in which a pharmacology case study from an area of pharmacotherapy will be discussed and assessed. Three papers on the same subject but representing different types of paper will be discussed. Students will be expected to identify the advantages and disadvantages of each paper, compare the scope and focus, recognize the type of study in each, and the category of the question. This coursework will encourage critical evaluation and reflective learning skills. (Word count for reflective section 250 words). Written feedback will give a breakdown of marks and assessor's comments. The EBP Case Study will be released in Week 3 following the EBP lecture and the completed assignment must be submitted by the end of Week 12. Students must upload a copy of their assignment onto Blackboard Learn. Further guidance will be given during the Semester. Regular formative assessment opportunities will be offered throughout the module and students are strongly encouraged to engage with all formative assessment exercises in order to self-evaluate personal progress with learning. Summative assessment of this module is through Coursework (30%) and a Sessional Examination (70%). Details of summary marking standards for mark bands/grades, etc. will be given. As always, students should be vigilant with regards avoiding plagiarism in submitted work. Feedback will come in many different forms and channels. Given this, it is important that students pay attention to the oral feedback and comments they are receiving in and out of class, and written feedback on assignments and other work. Students should be constantly alert and mindful of the feedback offered to them. Within this module feedback will take the form of: Introduction of learning objectives in module/classes, and by Module Co-Ordinator / Tutor(s). General comments made in lectures/tutorials/seminars (e.g. discussion and debate - in- class or online). Tips on how to best approach assignment(s) and examination(s) to maximize student learning and performance. Help, advice, and comments by Tutors including specific verbal comments about work, progress, and performance, in and out of class. Specific written comments on work to help indicate progress and develop understanding. Guidance and advice on academic progress from assigned Studies Advisor(s) and other Staff. 30% Coursework 70% Examination READING LIST Required: Students will be directed to a number of specific references for library material and other learning resources in scheduled classes. In addition, students are required, and strongly advised to conduct their own independent reading following guidance from the Tutors delivering the module, which should include consultation of recommended texts and journals.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module provides an understanding of applied and systems pharmacology of direct relevance to diverse clinical, industrial, and research careers, with an emphasis on development and application of advanced knowledge and skills, including utilization of evidence-based practice approach. RATIONALE It is essential that Biomedical Sciences graduates become familiar with Microbiology so as to be able to appreciate the impact of the microbial world on both human health and, in particular, infectious disease. In practical terms, an understanding of microbiology is essential if we are to successfully diagnose, track and treat infections and this module provides an overview of the role of microbiology in all these areas. AIMS To provide the student with knowledge and understanding of: the fundamental biological properties of various types of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protists); the roles of microorganisms in human infection; the roles of microorganisms in human health; the means by which infections are controlled using chemotherapeutic intervention; the principles underlying different laboratory diagnostic technologies; the principles of epidemiology with an emphasis on applications to control Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Describe the major biological attributes of different microbial groups (structure, physiology, biochemistry and genetics) and discuss how these contribute to microbial- host interactions in the infectious disease process. Provide a detailed and in-depth account of how antibiotics and other classes of chemotherapeutic agents work and relate this knowledge to mechanisms of resistance and, in the case of antibiotics, systems of resistance transfer. Critically discuss laboratory investigation of infectious disease in the context of isolation and identification of microorganisms, the choice of appropriate diagnostic technology and the role of epidemiology in public health and infection control. Retrieve, assemble and critically discuss information describing system infections CONTENT Topics covered in online lectures: A brief history of microbiology. Bacteria: cell structure and function. Bacteria: growth, metabolism and genetic systems. Principles and practices of sterilization and disinfection. Eucaryotic microbes: fungi. Eucaryotic microbes: protists and helminths. Eucaryotic viruses and viral diseases. Procaryotic viruses. Microbial taxonomy: classical and molecular systems, metagenomics for environmental analysis. Human-Microbe interactions: normal microbiota (emphasis on gut microbiome), role of microbiota in health (nutrition, immune regulation), role of microbiota in non-infectious disease (obesity, diabetes, cancer). Human-Microbe interactions: pathogenic mechanisms of microorganisms. Epidemiology and transmission mechanisms of infectious disease, Clinical Microbiology: Traditional diagnostic methodology- culture and immunological methods. Clinical Microbiology: Molecular diagnostic systems- nucleic acid and analytical chemistry approaches. Microbial typing schemes: application of biological and molecular systems in Infection Control. Antibiotics: mode of action, resistance mechanisms and transfer of resistance. Antiviral and antifungal chemotherapy: mode of action and emerging resistance Overview of infections by system: Gastrointestinal tract, Respiratory Tract, Sexually transmitted diseases, Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs). SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) The content of this module is designed to align with SDG 3 by providing students with an understanding of good health and wellbeing in the context of medical microbiology and it's wider application. SDG 4 is also highlighted in this module by providing the students with transferable skills they will be able to use throughout their academic career and to promote lifelong learning. The module also aligns with SDG 2 and SDG 6 in that students acquire knowledge and transferable skills applicable to the sustainable supply and management of safe food and water. Finally, the module also aligns with SDG 5 and 8. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS This module will be delivered fully online through a series of lectures supported by on line discussions and tutorials. The lectures will provide an overview of the main aspects of the topic. Students will be expected to use this material as a guide for directed outside reading, which will be specifically associated with each topic. Students will be directed to read both text book chapters and journal articles and reviews as appropriate. Practicals have been chosen to illustrate the concepts discussed in the lectures and to help with understanding of the principles and application of key methodologies used with a clinical microbiology laboratory. The practicals can be undertaken either in the student's place of work (if they are employed in an appropriate laboratory and have access to the necessary facilities) or at Ulster's Coleraine campus. Tutorials will be used to provide guidance on completion of the coursework tasks and to prepare students for the examination. Tutorials will normally comprise real-time chat rooms. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written examination [60%] This will consist of a 2-hour written examination comprising two sections. Section A will contain 40 MCQ / short answer questions (40% of the marks). All topics covered in lectures will be represented by this batch of questions and there will be no choice for students. This is designed to ensure that students have to cover all topics on the module. Section B will be essay type questions and students must answer 2 questions from a choice of 6 (60% of the marks). This section is designed to allow students to demonstrate their in-depth knowledge of individual topics. Report [40%] Practical Portfolio The practical portfolio will provide students with experience in performing experiments, interpreting data and writing a scientific report comprised of two practicals. The practicals are based around developing experience and understanding of relevant medical microbiology methods.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module provides an introduction to the biology of microorganisms that cause human infection. The module explores the diversity of pathogenic mechanisms in operation across a range of diseases and there is an important focus on recent advances in our understanding of host-microbe interactions. A major goal of the module is to provide examples of how this knowledge can be translated into practical ways to diagnose and control microbial pathogens. This is accomplished by an in-depth consideration of; the principles of disinfection and sterilisation, the theoretical background to current diagnostic techniques and an appreciation of how epidemiological monitoring can be used to control Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI). RATIONALE This module is designed to provide advanced understanding in immunology sufficient to underpin further study in the biomedical sciences. Students will be assisted to gain confidence in their knowledge of essential concepts sufficient for their application to both diagnostic and research laboratory settings. SDG3,4,5,6,13 AIMS This module aims to provide an advanced understanding of the structure, organisation and function of the human immune system and its components in health and disease, including in the diagnosis and treatment of human illnesses. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Outline in detail the fundamental components of the human immune system and the pathways encompassing the innate and adaptive immune response. Explain the series of events involved in lymphocyte development and maturation including the achievement of a diverse immune repertoire of lymphocytes as well as the steps involved in lymphocyte activation and differentiation. Demonstrate an understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of immunological disorders and the associated diagnostic and therapeutic approaches used in a clinical setting. Carry out fundamental laboratory techniques involved in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease associated with immune dysfunction and critically analyse data pertinent to a clinical setting. CONTENT Immunology aligns with the following Ulster Universities Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The module content is designed to provide students with an understanding of how immunology directly contributes to the improvement of human health (SDG3) and explores the societal impact of advances in immunology in the prevention, management and treatment of disease. Addressing infectious diseases through the study of human immunology can contribute to preventing and controlling diseases that affect food security (SDG2), reduced inequality (SDG10) and also in the promotion of a healthier workforce leading to increased productivity and economic growth (SDG8). This module in immunology provides quality education (SDG4) by enhancing students' understanding of the immune system, diseases, and public health, contributing to a well-rounded education in health sciences. Students of this module learn the value of multidisciplinary partnerships between academia, research institutions, and the healthcare sector for advancing knowledge in immunology and developing effective strategies for disease prevention and control (SDG17). Organisation and components of the human immune system. The innate immune response including inflammation, phagocytosis, complement and wound healing. The acquired immune response: memory and specificity, antigens, antibodies, MHC/TCR and molecular immunology. Immunity in defence and disease: immunity to microbes, immunotherapy and prophylaxis. Immune dysfunction: autoimmunity, hypersensitivity, immune oncology, immunodeficiencies, neoplastic diseases of the immune system and transplantation reactions.

The acquired immune response: memory and specificity, antigens, antibodies, MHC/TCR and molecular immunology. Immunity in defence and disease: immunity to microbes, immunotherapy and prophylaxis. Immune dysfunction: autoimmunity, hypersensitivity, immune oncology, immunodeficiencies, neoplastic diseases of the immune system and transplantation reactions. Current techniques used in immunology for the laboratory investigation, diagnosis and monitoring of disease. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Teaching will comprise structured online lecture materials and tutorials. Tutorials will be delivered using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra for direct verbal/visual interaction between tutor and students using Powerpoint presentations. Independent learning will be facilitated through directed reading and students will be encouraged to broaden their knowledge by utilising the widest range of available learning resources. Online simulations (online practicals) will require from students to work through a series of test stages and to analyse data to provide information supportive of clinical decision-making. The virtual learning environment Blackboard Learn (BBL) will be the predominant mode of module delivery. Every student will have an assigned e-tutor for academic guidance and support. The School's eLearning Support Unit will assist academic contributors to deliver the highest possible standard of learning. Online support to assist learning will include self-assessment quizzes on every 'lecture', case studies, publications and relevant web links. The module is fully on-line). ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Written examination [60%] A 2-hour paper which is divided into two Sections. Section A is Multiple choice questions worth 40% of the overall exam marks and Section B is a choice of essay type questions worth 60% of the overall exam marks. Report [40%] A portfolio of two practicals: ELISA Practical (500 words) Students will analyse data from an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) experiment to detect and quantify specific proteins associated with disease. This assessment aims to evaluate their understanding of immunoassay techniques, including the principles of antigen-antibody interactions and signal detection. The assessment criteria will assess data interpretation, experimental quality control and analysis of results in a clinical setting. Flow Cytometry Practical (500 words) Students will analyse results from Flow Cytometric analysis related to a clinical scenario. The data will relate to the quantification of cells based on various parameters such as size, granularity, and specific surface markers. This assessment focuses on competence in the understanding of the application of flow cytometry principles and their use clinically. Students will be provided with the UU assessment criteria associated with level 6. The students will also have access to online tutorials/Q&A sessions to ensure they are sufficient prepared for each coursework report assessment. Students will be provided with exemplar answers alongside general guidance for undertaking the written examination to ensure they are aware of the standard required. They will be provided with written feedback for all coursework pieces submitted within 20 working days. They will be provided with feedback through forums and discussion boards online with the Blackboard Learn module area.

RATIONALE This module introduces core principles of histopathology and cytopathology, preparing the student for further in-depth study of disease processes and professional practice in clinical diagnostic and research laboratory settings. SDGs: SDG3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG4 (Quality Education) SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). AIMS To introduce the principles and techniques used in histology and cytology, and to appreciate the applications of macroscopic and microscopic approaches in the study of gross structure and ultrastructure of normal cells and tissues and the structural changes which may occur during disease. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the core scientific terminology, principles and techniques of Cellular Pathology that underpin clinical practice, including aiding diagnosis, treatment selection and management. Describe gross structure and ultrastructure of normal cells and tissues, recognizing structural changes associated with the aetiology, pathology, and progression of disease.

LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Students will learn by participating in lectures (available on BBLearn), practical classes (available on site at Ulster or at work place), directed reading, and engaging with other learning resources. Lectures will be used to present the facts and principles of the subject material. Practical work will reinforce the theoretical aspects of the module and give practical training in the use of methods and techniques used in the cellular pathology laboratory. Web-based learning will provide an interactive platform for students which will reinforce both the lecture material and the practical class experience. Students will be expected to engage fully in learning activities including engaging in formative assessment opportunities. Self- directed independent learning will also be encouraged through completion of summative module assessment, which will focus on different academic and practical aspects of cellular pathology, designed to develop a range of skills. The module is fully on-line. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Report [50%] This takes the form of a case study report based on either a Histology or Cytology clinical case. Coursework 1 Assessment guidance: Case study(s): The case study will comprise of a clinical report detailing symptoms, tests, diagnosis and treatment/management of a patient. The diagnosis should be justified with sound clinical and microscopic findings. The report should be written as a word document, 1500 words maximum (title, figures, tables, references, appendices will not be part of the word count) Cumulatively the Cellular Pathology Case Study contributes 50% to the total module mark. In addition to receiving their individual marks, students will be given feedback against the expected standard, and the class will be given feedback on performance with advice for improvement/enhancement. Class Test [50%] Coursework 2 Assessment guidance This takes the form of a class test based on Weeks 1-6 lectures to assess the Cellular Pathology material and will be held during week 11. The test will comprise of Section A 20 MCQs and Section B 5 out of 10 short answer questions with 1.5 hours. Cumulatively the Class Test contributes 50% to the total module mark. In addition to receiving their individual marks, students will be given feedback against the expected standard, and the class will be given feedback on performance with advice for improvement/enhancement. Regular formative assessment opportunities will be offered throughout the module and students are strongly encouraged to engage with all formative assessment exercises in order to self-evaluate personal progress with learning. Summative assessment of this module is through Coursework (100%) primarily undertaken during Weeks 01 to 06 of the module. Details of summary marking standards for mark bands/grades, etc. will be given. As always, students should be vigilant with regards avoiding plagiarism in submitted work. Feedback: Feedback will come in many different forms and channels. Given this, it is important that students pay attention to the oral feedback and comments they are receiving in and out of class, and written feedback on assignments and other work. Students should be constantly alert and mindful of the feedback offered to them. Feedback will take the form of: Introduction of learning objectives in module/classes, and by Module Co-Ordinator / Tutor(s). General comments made in lectures/tutorials/seminars (e.g. discussion and debate - in- class or online). Tips on how to best approach assignment(s) and examination(s) to maximize student learning and performance. Help, advice, and comments in practical sessions by Tutors and/or Demonstrators. More specific verbal comments about work, progress, and performance, in and out of class. Specific written comments on work to help indicate progress and develop understanding. Guidance and advice on academic progress from assigned Studies Advisor(s) and other Staff Each assessment is accompanied by a specific rubric spreadsheet containing a section for comments. Within this section, students will receive both a grade and feedback. The module requires a minimum mark of 40% in each assessment to pass. 100% Coursework 0% Examination READING LIST Required: Students will receive learning material in the format of a series of handouts/handbooks/workbooks/other material (mostly via BBLearn Learn), and will be directed to a range of up-to-date eLearning and online resources, including relevant scientific literature and other reading material. Students are strongly advised to conduct their own independent reading/learning following guidance from the Tutors delivering the module and individual Tutors may", "extract": "(LIMS), and supplementary laboratory work, Quality control and assurance (including IQC and EQA) and Cell Pathology Accreditation (UKAS and ISO 15189).

The module is designed to meet the changing needs of the cellular pathology laboratory and as such will provide up-to-date theoretical knowledge combined with practical laboratory based work experience. RATIONALE To obtain the qualification, students are required to complete a research investigation under supervision within a specialised area. This module seeks to direct students in developing research professionalism by building on the taught elements of their degree with a comprehensive research investigation in a medical research environment of a topic in the Biomedical or Biological Sciences. This opportunity will provide training in advanced research techniques within a data generating research project which will be original in approach and hypothesis driven. This will enable the student to engage in projects which have a complexity level consistent with advanced research, as well as giving the student a direct experience of medical research in a medical environment. The student, by making an original contribution to the research field, develops the skills of postgraduate, independent research, commensurate with their working environment A demonstration of the professional expertise of the successful student will be in the ability to publish their work in a peer- reviewed journal and communicate their findings. The following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are addressed in this module: Good Health and Well-being Quality Education Decent Work and Economic Growth Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure The pass mark for this module is 50%. AIMS To encourage students in experimental research at the forefront of medical research. To enhance students' ability to evaluate theoretical and experimental research evidence. To mentor students on a research approach. To provide an opportunity for self-motivation, independent and inter-dependent inquiry. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Communicate the results of a scientific investigation in a required format. Integrate the results obtained from research with published information. Plan all the essential steps to obtain practical, scientific information. Propose and defend the introduction, methods, results, discussion and conclusions of a scientific investigation. CONTENT Theory: Development of a research base in biomedical or biological processes and phenomena. Practical: Experience of research and required instrumentation. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS On commencing this module, students will have formulated a Project Proposal for their research investigation which must be approved by supervisors both at Ulster and the participating Medical School or Research Laboratory. Students will normally undertake this as part of their work in the Applied Research Methods module (BIO703, Semester 1). The Proposal will include: scientific background to the research topic; scientific hypothesis to be tested; plan on sample preparation and testing; discussion of the techniques to be used; analysis of costs; and consideration of the ethical requirements of the proposed work. The description, as outlined in the project proposal, must comply with the criteria for Masters- level projects. If necessary, the student under the advice of their Mentor may be required to modify and resubmit their work. For this research investigation, the student is required to continue reviewing the relevant scientific literature in discussions with their Mentor, thereby developing their scientific, critical analysis. A written record of such reviews is maintained and assists the student in presenting their assessment of the relevant, current literature. Projects are data generating, hypothesis driven and experimental; students gain the opportunity of utilising their practical ability in the calibration and functioning of modern instrumentation. As a corollary to this, students improve their ability in data recording. Where appropriate, students will be asked to defend the implementation of their plan of investigation. The presentation of their work, in the form of a scientific paper, enables students to develop their ability at writing scientific literature. This skill is acquired through regular contact with their Mentor who advises on the abstract, data presentation, text and references. It is expected that the work completed in this Medical Research Project will be published. The scientific paper is the culmination of their assessed work. This module is offered by hybrid learning.

As a corollary to this, students improve their ability in data recording. Where appropriate, students will be asked to defend the implementation of their plan of investigation. The presentation of their work, in the form of a scientific paper, enables students to develop their ability at writing scientific literature. This skill is acquired through regular contact with their Mentor who advises on the abstract, data presentation, text and references. It is expected that the work completed in this Medical Research Project will be published. The scientific paper is the culmination of their assessed work. This module is offered by hybrid learning. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Project [100%] A Portfolio of the following: Part 1: Literature Review (5,000 words) Each dissertation is required to contain an in-depth literature review in which the student sets out a critique of work published and, on the basis of which specifies the aims of their research project and formulates their hypothesis. The review is expected to be scholarly in quality and presentation and submitted after 3 months. Literature Review will contribute 25% of the module mark. Part 2: Three-Month Progress Report (1,000 words) A Progress Report is submitted after three months and is to provide confirmation that work is progressing. The report will indicate the project preparations which have been completed and what initial experiments have been conducted. Progress Report will contribute 5% of the module mark. Part 3: Extended Abstract (1,000 words) A more detailed progress report has to be handed in after 6 months to ensure that the work is being maintained within the expected time frame, progress has been made, and to identify problems that might have developed during the course of the project. This report, in the format of an Extended Abstract will contain more specific information on the project work than the three-month Report and is expected to critically evaluate the current progress in the light of the project plan. Extended Abstract will contribute 5% of the module mark. Part 4: Scientific Paper (8,000 words) The completed, experimental procedures are presented as a scientific paper, consistent with the style of a relevant journal. In this, candidates are required to follow the Instructions to Authors which are provided by every journal. (Photocopies of Instructions to Authors and an example of a published paper from the chosen journal are required). Scientific Paper will contribute 55% of the module mark. Coursework 5: Supervisors Report Supervisors are requested to submit a report indicating the degree of independence of the student and the quality and quantity of the student's approach. Supervisors are provided detailed guidelines for the completion of this report. Supervisors Report will contribute 10% of the module mark. Students must submit their laboratory notebook(s) [to the project provider] to indicate the progress of their work. This is qualitatively assessed by guidelines which reflect good, laboratory practice in the maintenance of accurate laboratory records. The Laboratory notebook does not contribute to the module mark. For each piece of coursework, students will be provided with assessment criteria for each marking band. Individual feedback will be written and detailed against each criteria as appropriate Each assessment is marked independently by two members of academic staff. Feedback is provided in written format, in the form of a completed Mark Sheet. A mark of at least 50% must be achieved in each element of assessment in order to pass the module. 100% Coursework 0% Examination READING LIST Required: Peer-reviewed journals relevant to the particular area of investigation. SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module provides the opportunity, through research, to integrate knowledge of the biomedical sciences by the research and elucidation of a chosen topic in the biomedical or biological sciences. RATIONALE This module will provide the student with a comprehensive understanding of current developments in stem cell biology. As this is a rapidly advancing field, students will learn to evaluate peer-reviewed scientific literature to provide them with skills for continued learning after the course has finished, enabling them to keep abreast of future advances. The following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are addressed in this module: Good Health and Well-being Quality Education Decent Work and Economic Growth Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure The pass mark for this module is 50%. AIMS The module will provide a general understanding of adult and embryonic stem cells and differentiation as well as an in-depth overview of the latest advances in the use of stem cell technology in regenerative medicine and related ethical issues. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Describe, evaluate and discuss fundamental processes of stem cell biology and associated ethical issues Critically evaluate new advances in the stem cell biology field Discuss the purpose, function and potential application of stem cell biology Search, acquire, organise and disseminate scientific knowledge in the context of stem cell biology CONTENT The module will be delivered as 12 major sessions: Stem Cell characteristics & sources Pluripotency Embryonic Stem Cells Haematopoietic Stem Cells Other Adult Stem Cells Induced pluripotent stem cells Genetic manipulation of stem cells Stem Cells and cloning Techniques for analysing genetic modifications Applications of stem cells in research Use of stem cells in regenerative medicine Stem Cell Legislation & Bioethics LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS The content will be taught through a combination of lecture material, online discussions and independent self-directed learning, all of which will be supported online (by e-tutors and on- campus staff). Peer support for distance learners will be provided through discussion boards. Lectures will be used to deliver core content and be illustrated using peer-reviewed articles where appropriate. Students will be expected to use independent study time to search for, read and summarise online resources, participate in online discussions and review and revise content and complete assignments. Workshops will be comprised of online discussions which will consolidate learning. Students will be directed to read key texts and peer-reviewed journal articles and reviews and post their analysis in the context of the subject matter.

discussions and independent self-directed learning, all of which will be supported online (by e-tutors and on- campus staff). Peer support for distance learners will be provided through discussion boards. Lectures will be used to deliver core content and be illustrated using peer-reviewed articles where appropriate. Students will be expected to use independent study time to search for, read and summarise online resources, participate in online discussions and review and revise content and complete assignments. Workshops will be comprised of online discussions which will consolidate learning. Students will be directed to read key texts and peer-reviewed journal articles and reviews and post their analysis in the context of the subject matter. Lectures will be used to deliver key concepts. The module is fully online. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Class Test [50%] Students will participate in a portfolio of 2 online class tests each consisting of a mixture of formats, such as multiple choice questions and short answer questions. Feedback will consist of model answers and comments on short answers. 40% - 2 online tests each worth 20% (word count equivalent: 1,000 words per test). Written assignment [50%] Students will produce an in-depth written report critically appraising a current advance in the stem cell research. Feedback will be by comments in several categories related to the critical review, ideally using a rubric system and level indicators. 60% (word count: 4,000 words). Portfolio of two class tests Two class tests (25% each) will be conducted during the semester to assess the material covered during the module. Students receive their score and feedback is released shortly after. These assessments allow students to assess their knowledge and understanding of the subject. Students have commented favourably on the use of coursework class tests so that they can gage their level of learning and build confidence. Each test will be 60 minutes duration, equating to a combined 20 hours of notional work and 10 credits. Written Assignment An in-depth written evaluation, critically appraising current advances in a subject area related to the module will be carried out. This written assessment (4,000 words) equates to 20 hours of notional assessment. Assessment work hours will include e.g. gathering, reading and organising information, drafting plans, writing-up/assembly, editing, revision and to prepare the final submission.

AIMS The teaching aims to achieve a high degree of competency in the practical use of scientific methodologies, their recording in laboratory books, application of the methodologies to a scientific question and presentation of methodologies in a format that is suitable for an audience of experts (i.e. a scientific seminar) or for publication (i.e. peer reviewed). LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Demonstrate competency in understanding, analysing and interpreting research methods and a comprehensive understanding of techniques and instrumentation. Apply the principles and methods of scientific inquiry and research design to plan an hypothesis-driven research project in the forefront of biomedical or biological sciences. Independently consider scientific problems and proffer their solutions. Demonstrate at a professional level an ability to communicate scientific methodology to peers, colleagues and others within a research environment. CONTENT Theory: development of critical understanding of application of methodologies to scientific research and their use to test hypotheses. Practical: experience in the use and documentation of scientific methodologies relevant to specific research areas. LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS The most significant component (>90%) of the learning on this module by the student is training and practical experience in development, optimisation and application of advanced scientific methods within the laboratory of the host institution under the guidance of their US based mentor. Every day during their internship the student will write up detailed laboratory notes of the components of the experiments they are undertaking in their mentors' laboratory. Periodically (1/2 a month) the mentor will examine the lab books and discuss the contents with the students giving detailed and formative feedback. This process underpins the coursework assessment for this module. Seminars are attended as a natural course of activity within the mentors' laboratory (approximately 1/month). Students are expected to integrate into laboratory scientific meetings (1/month) as well as attending departmental seminars provided at the host institution. Online Tutorials - Periodic contact (5-6 tutorials) are undertaken with the module coordinator to discuss content of seminars and progression of the methodologies used in their research projects. Students will be directed to read a variety of scientific texts (Journals, monographs, abstracts, books and online scientific material as is relevant to their particular research project). Students will be expected to present their methodological approach to the research question in both", "extract": "of lecture material, online discussions and independent self-directed learning, all of which will be supported online (by e-tutors and on- campus staff). Peer support for distance learners will be provided through discussion boards.", "vector": [-0.031742293387651443, -0.022071868181228638, -0.0771506056189537, -0.012591831386089325,

feedback. This process underpins the coursework assessment for this module. Seminars are attended as a natural course of activity within the mentors' laboratory (approximately 1/month). Students are expected to integrate into laboratory scientific meetings (1/month) as well as attending departmental seminars provided at the host institution. Online Tutorials - Periodic contact (5-6 tutorials) are undertaken with the module coordinator to discuss content of seminars and progression of the methodologies used in their research projects. Students will be directed to read a variety of scientific texts (Journals, monographs, abstracts, books and online scientific material as is relevant to their particular research project). Students will be expected to present their methodological approach to the research question in both written and oral form and receive constructive feedback from both their academic mentors, local experts in the field (Ulster) as well as the module coordinator. The module is offered blended learning. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Project [100%] A portfolio of the following: Part 1: Oral Assessment 1 The first piece of coursework is a ~20-minute seminar presented by the student on methodologies to be used in the research project and how they are applied to test the specific (hypothesis/hypothesises). Questions from the audience, mentor and assessors are also used to provide constructive feedback. This seminar is assessed by the Module Coordinator and feedback on content and style returned to the student (10% of final module mark). Part 2: Practical Skills Assessment 1 The second piece of assessment is an examination of the Laboratory Notebook kept by the student by the academic mentor. The Laboratory Notebook is used to draft scientific manuscripts and is a legal document used to record methodologies and data collected during a students' internship. Feedback on the Laboratory Notebook is ongoing throughout the internship and the mentor will provide feedback on the content, organisation, and neatness. This will be assessed by the mentor using a standardised form developed by the Module Coordinator (10% of final mark). Part 3: Practical Skills Assessment 2 (1,500 words) The third piece of coursework comprises all the methodologies (and modifications where appropriate) written in a format that is suitable for scientific publication. Critical feedback on the presentation of the Materials and Methods section is given by the mentor and Module Coordinator (40% of final coursework mark). Part 4: Oral Assessment 2 The final piece of coursework is a completion seminar on how the methodologies were used to address the hypothesis. Assessment is via an online seminar viewed by the mentor and Module Coordinator which critically reviews the presentation skills the student has developed relating to detailing experimental results. In addition, the student will draw conclusions from the results, appropriate to the data presented (40% of final mark). Each assessment is marked independently by two members of academic staff. Feedback is provided in written format, in the form of a completed Mark Sheet. The overall word equivalency is 12000 words. A mark of at least 50% must be achieved in each element of assessment in order to pass the module. 100% Coursework 0% Examination READING LIST Required: Journals, monographs, books and scientific articles directly related to research project SUMMARY DESCRIPTION The module in Advanced scientific methods comprises of tutorials, seminars and practicals which are aimed at promoting an advanced understanding of the application of scientific methods to a hypothesis in a specific field of scientific research. At the end of this module students should be able to demonstrate the ability to present scientific methodology in both written and oral formats, that are suitable for presentation at scientific conferences and for peer reviewed publication respectively.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module provides an introduction to the core areas of mathematics that form the foundation of science and engineering, and that are used throughout such courses at Ulster University. Tutorial classes provide an opportunity for students to deepen their knowledge by mastering fundamental mathematical techniques through problem solving. ACADEMIC SUBJECT Flexible and Continuing Education RATIONALE This module has been designed to establish a foundation for subsequent study of more advanced topics in science and technology. It is comprised of the fundamental knowledge required in chemistry, biology, physics and biotechnology to allow for further study in these areas. It allows the development of understanding in foundation level science across disciplines as well as up-skilling in practical abilities and techniques in an inclusive and equitable learning environment. AIMS To introduce the principles and main processes of biology and physics and recognise how this knowledge can be exploited for enhanced technology for the benefit of society.To study the underpinning principal factors which influence the structure, physical behaviour and chemical reactions of organic and inorganic molecules and/or groups and integrate this knowledge with that of both biology and physics. This module aligns with UNESCO sustainable development goal 4 by ensuring an inclusive and equitable learning environment for all. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Apply the principles of fundamental biology to the relationships between organism structures and functions and how environmental changes affect functioning of the body systems Account for physical and chemical features of molecules and understand how this affects the overall properties of the compound and accurately carry out calculations. Perform laboratory procedures safely and summarise and interpret experimental data logically while adapting an analytical approach to scientific enquiry. CONTENT Chemistry Electronic configuration of atoms and ions and shapes of simple molecules and ions (VSEPR) Periodic trends in physical and chemical properties Calculations involving the mole and concentrations Percentage yield Acid-base titrations Functional groups and chemical reactions Thermodynamics limited to enthalpy of reaction and Hess's Law Chemical Equilibrium Biology Introduction to principles of mammalian (including human) physiology, including structure, function, metabolsim and control Molecules involved in biology, carbohydrates, lipids and polymers. Cell structure of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Technology Introduction to historical aspects of modern biotechnology Units of measurement, mechanics and materials. Medical Physics Practicals Redox Titrations Chemical Structure Identification Preparation of an Aqueous Cream LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS This module is delivered by hybrid learning. This module is taught by lectures supported by tutorials, practicals and self-directed reading material, voice-supported presentations, and a variety of applied formative assessments. Practical exercises will also instruct students in the proper use of key laboratory equipment in a pharmaceutical chemistry laboratory. Students are provided with electronic materials for self-assessment and preparation for examinations. Self-directed, student-centred independent learning is also encouraged through completion of module coursework. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Report [30%] Practical reports will be written up independently as one document and submitted two weeks following the last practical session. The combined word count for the lab reports is 1000, these are given as work sheets that can be completed. These practical reports form 30% of the module coursework This will assess learning outcomes 3:Perform laboratory procedures safely and summarise and interpret experimental data logically while adapting and analytical approach to scientific enquiry. Class Test [70%] The class test is 2 hours in duration with section a containing 20 MCQs and worth 40% of the paper with section B containing 20 short answer questions worth 60%. Apply the principles of fundamental biology to the relationships between organism structures and functions and how environmental changes affect functioning of the body systems. Account for physical and chemical features of molecules and understand how this affects the overall properties of the compound and accurately carry out calculations.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module is designed to build on the material covered in the Foundation in Science and Technology (FCE010) and to provide a foundation for subsequent study of more advanced topics in chemistry or the life sciences. It comprises general organic chemistry, biochemistry and human physiology. ACADEMIC SUBJECT Flexible and Continuing Education RATIONALE This module forms part of the core teaching on the Diploma in International Studies. For students whose English is above an iELTS Level 6, this module provides opportunities for the learners to select an issue-based problem, specific to their chosen academic pathway (STE or BAHSS) upon which they will carry out investigative research. If appropriate, learners may also place this issue-based scenario within the context of their home country, whereby they can draw upon existing underpinning knowledge. This module seeks to hone the skills of the learner where they will develop heightened knowledge in their chosen pathway subject, as well as building on intrapersonal and academic skills including; decision-making, problem-solving, time-management, writing for purpose / audience, data handling, report writing and research methods. AIMS The aims of the Project-Based Learning project are to provide students with the opportunity to; Combine investigation into an authentic challenging civic issue aligned with their chosen pathway (STE / BAHSS) with a more in-depth project report Build links with appropriate internal and external networks and stakeholders Demonstrate understanding of the application of subject-aligned issue, in a real-world situation Employ primary and secondary investigative approaches and use relevant data and or sources that can endorse findings and core recommendations Build and develop a beneficial relationship with a supervisor and academic mentor LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Plan and execute a critical review of a real-world issue through the medium of a problem-based learning project via a negotiated plan with a supervisor Utilise a variety of research materials, including primary research, where appropriate Critically analyse a real world issue using both practitioner and academic matter Link a real world issue and subject specific knowledge examined through previous and current modules CONTENT This module will be delivered in ten sessions as follows; Selection of appropriate issue-based subject within progression degree area Setting realistic timeframes Research Methods - Primary and Secondary Sources - discriminating information Understanding Quantitative and Qualitative information and analysis Writing a Project Proposal Writing a Literature Review - Treating Information Critically Creating Survey - Open and Closed questioning techniques and answer facilitation Data Gathering - Presenting factual information in written contexts Synthesising information, formulation of arguments, supporting arguments Drawing conclusions / Making recommendations LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Students will attend 2 x 2hr sessions per week. This session will take place on campus. Teaching sessions will take a mixed format incorporating direct teaching/lecturing, class- based discussions, class workshops and individual tutorial time. Full attendance will be expected at all sessions and to complete all tasks assigned in preparation for, during and in summation of the module. Students will be supported online throughout the module via Blackboard module area, and with workshops on how to project manage. All resources used during each session will be available 1 week before class and held for future use on Blackboard to support learners. This module is offered by hybrid learning and the Blackboard environment is used to both provide information to students and also to support independent learning. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Project [100%] Individual Research Project Devise an individual project on an academic subject of your choice, which you can carry out primary and secondary research. The project title must be agreed with the Module Co- ordinator. You are required to evidence five elements within your Project - Proposal, Literature Review, Survey Construction, Data Analysis and Recommendations. Going forward into your undergraduate study, you will be required to demonstrate skills of analysis, research and coming to evidence-based judgements to support your ideas. Project Proposal - 15% of module - 600 words Devise a proposal for your research project. Within the proposal you must indicate the rationale and justifications and goals for taking on the research. Literature Review - 25% of module - 1,000 words Carry out a literature review, assessing a range of secondary research linked to your chosen project subject. Analyse and extract from your chosen sources the most significant information which adds value to your own research and subject area. Review each source evidencing your ability to write academically and demonstrate how these sources help support or challenge your own research project. Survey Construction - 15% of module - 600 words Using technical software such as Survey Monkey or Google Forms devise a survey which has both quantitative and qualitative opportunities to gather data. Ensure your survey is responded to by as many participants as possible and appropriate. The survey must include at least 15 questions. Data Formatting and Analysis - 30% of module - 1,500 words Supported by a range of diagrammatical features, explain each survey question response - interpreting what the data is saying and what it does not say. Pay close attention to where there is a varying response - this gives you more opportunity to write and analyse. Thorough analysis of each question with correlating diagram (pie, bar, line, doughnut) will add value to report. Recommendations - 15% of module - 600 words Having completed reporting on the evidence, formulate a range of appropriate and well measured Recommendations (5) which can be presented as a result of your research. Assessment Your project will be assessed on", "extract": "and performance in and out of class.

Palgrave Study Skills 2nd Edition SUMMARY DESCRIPTION This module seeks to harness English Language capabilities and develop critical thinking skills to raise levels of written English. This module seeks to inform, develop and challenge students regarding their normative thinking strategies. Critical thinking can enhance students' interest, motivation and success in a given subject. These skills can be transferred into writing in English and in preparation for academic readiness, success and progression at undergraduate level. This module seeks to establish and advance within each student, sound academic capabilities, particularly critical assessment, with an ability to challenge and justify arguments reached. ACADEMIC SUBJECT Flexible and Continuing Education RATIONALE This module forms part of the core teaching on the International Foundation Programme. Exploring Cultural Identities offers all learners the opportunity to explore ideas and realities of culture, as well as, self, group, community and national identities. The module offers students time and security to explore ideas unique to their own cultural identity against the backdrop of cultural identity issues specific to Northern Ireland. Providing students with a coherent, impartial analysis of the cultural identity themes that have shaped Northern Ireland society is central to this module's delivery. By so doing, we offer the student a context for an emergent modern society", "extract": "academic contexts Converse confidently with peers and teaching staff, regarding the expectations and regulations of writing and speaking in formal, informal, and academic contexts Illustrate a working knowledge of the conventions of written English with respect to researching, drafting, mind-mapping, note-taking, information gathering, presentation construction, grammar and referencing Demonstrate an ability to formulate an argument and support it with relevant, rational justifications and academic theory; integrating it with synthesized information to create and support a cohesive argument CONTENT This module will be delivered in ten sessions as follows; Critical Thinking Skills - Defining Critical Thinking and its value Accurate interpretation of reading Critical Reading skills - strategies to aid Critical Thinking Critical Writing - strategies to aid Critical Writing Reflective Writing Parts / Whole Critical Thinking and Writing Academic Reading and Research in preparation for Academic Writing Principals of academic writing incorporating Critical Thinking skills Formulation and development of an argument Essay writing with referencing LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Students will attend 2 x 2hr taught sessions per week.

ACADEMIC SUBJECT Flexible and Continuing Education RATIONALE This module forms part of the core teaching on the International Foundation Programme. Exploring Cultural Identities offers all learners the opportunity to explore ideas and realities of culture, as well as, self, group, community and national identities. The module offers students time and security to explore ideas unique to their own cultural identity against the backdrop of cultural identity issues specific to Northern Ireland. Providing students with a coherent, impartial analysis of the cultural identity themes that have shaped Northern Ireland society is central to this module's delivery. By so doing, we offer the student a context for an emergent modern society into which they can draw comparisons, differences and value judgements from their own experience of cultural identity. AIMS To introduce students to cultural and identity concepts that provide opportunities for greater understanding of a range of cultural identities and intercultural communication. To investigate students' own cultural identity and their culture capital. To explore key themes underpinning Northern Irish society and ideas of culture, nationality, identity, language, faith, arts and media. To assess the concept of cultures within cultures - raising an awareness of the range of cultures within Northern Ireland. To examine pivotal events which helped form Cultural identities specific to Northern Ireland. To share cultural identity and experience with others at local and international level. To familiarise students with Northern Ireland's place within UK and Ireland, within European, and in a global context. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Discuss key themes that underpin Northern Ireland society and the range of cultures found within it Collaborate with local young people in a community-based environment to deliver meaningful engagement pertaining to culture and identity Illustrate how cultural identity is a central theme to one\u2019s sense of self, gender, race, group, society at local, national and international levels Investigate pivotal events which shape, determine and affect cultural identities CONTENT Defining Cultural Identities Cultural Identities - The Northern Ireland case Shared City / Divided Spaces Faith groups underpinning Cultural Identity Democracy through Division Who we are presentations Widening Access workshop with local young people Cultures within Cultures Celebration of Culture Digital Story Showcase LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS Students will attend 2 x 2 hr sessions per week, with sessions taking place on campus.

Social Attitudes in Northern Ireland, Blackstaff Press, Belfast, 1991 Edited by Peter Stringer and Gillian Robinson (1991) SUMMARY DESCRIPTION Within the module of Exploring Cultural Identities, learners will be offered the opportunity to explore ideas of identity embedded within their own national identity, as a new resident of Northern Ireland and as an International Student within Ulster University. This variety of contexts offers students time and security to explore ideas unique to their own cultural identity against the backdrop of cultural identity issues specific to Northern Ireland. Students will explore the variant cultural identities within Northern Irish society, examine how those differing cultures have added to society, shaping culture in a Post-Troubles emergent society. Students will be able to draw on their own experience as well as those gleaned from cultural activities within the module, to discover similarities, differences, expectations and cultural norms which express and redefine ideas of culture. RATIONALE This module serves as an introduction to the core principles of immunology providing students with a fundamental understanding of the human immune system, its components, functions and mechanisms of action. The module covers the innate and adaptive immunity, acute and chronic inflammation, mechanisms of action of immune system components, principles of vaccination, immunopathological conditions and abnormal immune function. AIMS To provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the human immune system, its components, functions and its critical role in maintaining health. LEARNING OUTCOMES Successful students will be able to: Develop a comprehensive knowledge of the cellular components of the immune system, including macrophages, T cells, and B cells, and their respective roles in the innate and adaptive immune responses. Demonstrate a clear understanding of the processes involved in antigen recognition, presentation, and the generation of immune responses, emphasizing the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin these critical functions. Establish connections between immunological principles and their application in health and disease, identifying how the immune system responds to common pathogens and the implications of immune dysfunction in the development of diseases. Develop proficiency in basic immunological laboratory techniques (e.g. flow cytometry and immunoassays), including the ability to analyze and interpret experimental data, fostering practical skills essential for immunology. CONTENT Lectures Introduction to immunology including an overview of the immune system: cells, tissues and organs of the immune system The innate immune response including inflammation, phagocytosis, complement and wound healing The adaptive immune response: memory and specificity, antigens, antibodies, MHC/TCR and molecular immunology Immunity in defense and disease: immunity to pathogens; principles of vaccination Immune dysfunction: autoimmunity, hypersensitivity, immunodeficiency, neoplastic diseases of the immune system and transplantation reactions Current techniques used in immunology for the laboratory investigation, diagnosis and monitoring of disease Practical sessions The first experiment will provide the student with the opportunity to carry out an ELISA protocol to provide an understanding of its diagnostic and prognostic use within the area of immunology. The second experiment will provide the student with the opportunity to prepare screened blood for analysis on the flow cytometer in the laboratory. They will then get the opportunity to observe the flow cytometer in use with simulated results to demonstrate a clinic to laboratory scenario. Sustainable Development Goals Immunology aligns with the following Ulster Universities Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The module content is designed to provide students with an understanding of how immunology directly contributes to the improvement of human health (SDG3) and explores the societal impact of advances in immunology in the prevention , management and treatment of disease. Addressing infectious diseases through the study of human immunology can contribute to preventing and controlling diseases that affect food security (SDG2), reduced inequality (SDG10) and also in the promotion of a healthier workforce leading to increased productivity and economic growth (SDG8). This module in immunology provides quality education (SDG4) by enhancing students' understanding of the immune system, diseases, and public health, contributing to", "extract": "an interesting, insightful and thoughtful piece of creative work that helps to define your time at Ulster University.

Sustainable Development Goals Immunology aligns with the following Ulster Universities Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The module content is designed to provide students with an understanding of how immunology directly contributes to the improvement of human health (SDG3) and explores the societal impact of advances in immunology in the prevention , management and treatment of disease. Addressing infectious diseases through the study of human immunology can contribute to preventing and controlling diseases that affect food security (SDG2), reduced inequality (SDG10) and also in the promotion of a healthier workforce leading to increased productivity and economic growth (SDG8). This module in immunology provides quality education (SDG4) by enhancing students' understanding of the immune system, diseases, and public health, contributing to a well-rounded education in health sciences. Students of this module learn the value of multidisciplinary partnerships between academia, research institutions, and the healthcare sector for advancing knowledge in immunology and developing effective strategies for disease prevention and control (SDG17) LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS The module employs a variety of teaching methods to enhance understanding and engagement, including lectures, interactive discussions, laboratory sessions, and guest lectures from experts in the field (e.g. Clinical Immunologist). Tutorials and seminars will supplement lecture material with worked examples thus facilitating a problem-solving approach to relevant concepts. Practical exercises will involve the use of laboratory equipment and chemicals to organise and conduct a practical experiment thus giving students an understanding of the associated processes involved in the clinical setting. This will provide the students with the necessary laboratory skills in a variety of techniques germane to the field of immunology. Students will be directed to read prescribed sections in the required text or other sources as directed by the teaching team to provide a broad appreciation of the subject. Students will be expected to engage fully in learning activities of this module. Students are encouraged to participate in class discussions and undertake independent research to deepen their knowledge. These will include self-assessment material delivered through the module VLE, preparation for laboratory classes and the reading of prescribed material in advance of lectures, tutorials, seminars and practical classes. Students are required to engage with feedback offered by staff on student work. The module is offered by hybrid learning. ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK Practical skills assessment [40%] Practical Report (40%) Two Practical's will teach the application of immunological principles in the laboratory. The assessment of each practical will be through the completion of a laboratory logbook during the practical sessions. This will require the student to synthesize the data generated during each practical and to interpret this data within the context of immunology. Feedback for each practical report will be provided using the online module web page. The Practical Reports will each contribute 20% of the module mark (i.e. 40% in total) and will have an indicative word count of 500 words for answers within each practical. Both elements must meet the threshold standard for the module to be passed. ELISA Practical (500 words) Students will perform an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to detect and quantify specific proteins. This assessment aims to evaluate their understanding of immunoassay techniques, including the principles of antigen-antibody interactions and signal detection. The assessment criteria will test accuracy in preparing reagents and samples; proficiency in executing ELISA protocols; data interpretation and analysis of results. Flow Cytometry Practical (500 words) Students will engage in a Flow Cytometry practical to analyze and quantify cells based on various parameters such as size, granularity, and specific surface markers. This assessment focuses on competence in sample preparation, accuracy in gating and analyzing flow cytometry data and the application of flow cytometry principles to solve experimental A minimum mark of 40% is required to be achieved in each method of assessment. Class Test [60%] Class Test: Multiple Choice and Short Answer Questions (1 hour) A class test will be administered covering all aspects of basic immunology, including theoretical concepts and practical applications discussed in lectures. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and short answer questions will assess knowledge recall and understanding of fundamental immunological principles. Feedback will be provided through: Introduction of learning objectives in the module and each class by the Module Coordinator / Lecturer Discussions and debates within the lectures, tutorial classes and practical classes Tips on how to approach assignments and examinations Help, advice and comments in practical classes by lecturers, tutors and/or demonstrators Specific verbal comments on student work to help indicate progress and develop student understanding Feedback will be provided through written comments on lab reports, emphasizing experimental technique, data interpretation, and the application of theoretical knowledge. Marked scripts with comments on correct/incorrect responses for MCQs and short answer questions Assessment Feedback will be provided within 20 working days. 100% Coursework 0% Examination READING LIST Required: Abul K.

An extensive print collection at the Coleraine campus library coupled with an ever-growing electronic book (ebook) collection ensures book provision is available for both on-campus and fully online students completing programmes. The Life and Health Science librarian team responsible for the Biomedical Science programmes deliver Library instruction both face to face and online with content ranging from basic induction through to systematic review searching. Synchronous and asynchronous content is available to support students studying full and part time as well as, again, for those on and off campus. Coleraine Campus Library There are libraries on each of the three campuses of Ulster University. The new Belfast Campus library opened in September 2022 and offers sector leading facilities. The Derry~Londonderry campus library underwent major refurbishment during the summer of 2019 and the Coleraine campus library received a scaled down refurbishment at that same time. At Coleraine, internal walls were replaced with glass to provide extra lighting, additional flexible learning spaces were introduced and the tutor area of the Library classroom was refitted. The points below summarise the Library resources, services and facilities available on the Coleraine campus where the on-campus Biomedical Science programmes are delivered. Additional content is provided throughout this report on the Library Service\u2019s electronic offering to support both on-campus and e-learning students: The Coleraine library occupies the top floor of the Main Building on the Coleraine campus. The entrance area provides informal and comfortable seating to allow users to meet and relax. Staffed Information Point (issue desk) during staffed opening hours as well as self-service kiosks allowing users to issue and renew Library items and book return bins allowing users to return their items. The IT Suite (Library classroom) contains 40 study spaces, each one with a networked PC. This space can be used when there are no classes scheduled and is designated a silent zone. The Open Access Area contains 137 study spaces, each one with a networked PC. This area is open 24/7. The library is zoned for different levels of noise \u2013 there are designated silent, quiet, and noisy zones. While Reading Room 1 and Reading Room 2 contain the print book and journal collections, there are ample spaces for individual study. Reading Room 1 includes benching and is a designated silent zone. Between the two Reading rooms is a smaller room reserved for silent study. All study spaces have power connections for mobile devices. There are five group study rooms in the library; there is also a group study room reserved for student support sessions. Students can use the online booking system to book a Library group study room for up to one week in advance. More information is available at bookings.Library.ulster.ac.uk/. Total study spaces with a PC: 177; total study spaces without a PC: 352 Laptops are available from the self-service unit in the library. Self-service laptops are available 24 hours a day for loan periods of 4 hours. Students may only borrow one laptop at a time and can borrow another upon return of any previous laptop loan. Multi-functional devices (MFDs) are available for printing, copying and scanning. Term-time Opening Hours 24-hour access: The Library offers 24-hour spaces to Ulster University students and staff across the three campuses. 24-hour access includes access to study environments, social learning spaces and access to computing, printing, scanning and photocopying facilities. In the Coleraine campus library, 24-hour access is available in the IT Open Access area, the group study rooms and the soft seating area at the front of the library. Staffed opening hours: Staffed opening hours include enquiry services and support, borrowing and access to book stock: Library Resources \u2013 Print and Electronic The Library provides access to a huge range of Web-based electronic information sources, both on and off-campus; all electronic Library resources are available 24/7. This will be of particular value to students on e-learning programmes, placement, studying part-time or only on-campus on selected days. The Library Catalogue of the entire Library stock can be accessed directly from the Library Homepage using any device with an internet connection. Remote access is available for checking loans information, placing book reservations and for renewals. Students completing e-learning programmes will be able to avail of our ebooks available from the Library Catalogue and other ebook databases. Please note, the Library does not offer a book postal service for students. Throughout the year, there will be close co-operation between Library and academic staff in managing the allocation for information resources. This includes the monitoring of the journal subscriptions and the ordering of book stock and electronic resources to support individual programmes. Consultation is also made with each of the faculties to agree their future requirements for Library materials. To promote the effective use of the full range of Library resources available, faculties submit their current reading lists for adding to the Library\u2019s reading list database (KeyLinks). Students can then access their reading lists directly through the Library Homepage or via Blackboard Learn. The reading lists contain links to e-books, e-journal articles, Library Catalogue entries for print books, websites and scanned content. An example of the current reading list for module BMS108 \u201cScientific Communication and Statistics\u201d is available at https://ulster.keylinks.org/new-ui/hierarchy/list/7191 Book Borrowing Undergraduate and postgraduate taught students may borrow a total of 20 books as follows: Print books relevant Biomedical Science programmes are located at the following shelf marks in the Coleraine campus library.

As part of the Library\u2019s e-first policy, there has been significant investment in the development of an extensive ebook collection. This investment will continue to grow in the coming years replacing the print collection whenever possible. A search of the Library Catalogue, using the following search terms, retrieves the following ebook figures: The Library subscribes to a number of ebook databases which Biomedical Science staff and students may avail of; all are available on and off-campus: Electronic Journals A sample of titles providing current, full text journal access is listed below: Accounts of Chemical Research ACS Catalysis; ACS Central Science; ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering; Advanced Functional Materials; Angewandte Chemie - International Edition; Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; Annals of Medicine; Applied and Environmental Microbiology; Behavioural Pharmacology; Biological Reviews; BMJ Best Practice; British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology; British Journal of Haematology; British Journal of Nutrition; British Journal of Pharmacology; Cancer; Cancer Research Circulation; Carbon; Catalysis Review- Science and Engineering; Chemical Engineering Journal; Chemical Reviews; Chemical Science; Chemical Society Reviews; Chemistry of Materials; Chinese Journal of Catalysis; Clinical and Experimental Immunology; Clinical and Experimental Medicine; Clinical Cancer Research; Clinical Medicine; Clinical Microbiology Reviews; Critical Reviews in Clinical Laboratory Sciences; Cytokine and Growth Factor Reviews; Desalination; eBioMedicine; EMBO Journal; Emerging Infectious Diseases Endocrinology; Energy Chem; Epidemiology and Infection; European Journal of Immunology; Environmental Science & Technology; Food Hydrocolloids; Genetics; Immunology; JAAPA: Journal of the American Academy of Physician Assistants; Journal of Biological Rhythms; Journal of Clinical Immunology; Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry; Journal of Materials Chemistry A; Journal of Medicine; Journal of Pathology; Journal of Physician Assistant Education; Journal of the American Chemical Society ; Mass Spectrometry Reviews; Medicine; Microbiology; Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews; Molecular Systems Biology; Nano Letters; Nature; Nature Communications; Nature Materials; Nature Medicine; Nature Protocols; Nature Reviews Cancer; Nature Reviews Drug Discovery; Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology; Nature Reviews Chemistry; Nature Reviews Microbiology; New Scientist; Nutrition and Cancer; Nutrition Reviews; Pharmacology; PLoS Biology; Polymer Reviews; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; Science; Scientific American; Small Methods; Surface Science Reports. Journals are subscribed to individually and as bundles from publishers including Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press, Sage, Taylor and Francis and Wiley. Relevant Databases There are over 100 different subject databases available to support research; many of these are full text providing access to journal articles, e-books, reports, statistics, news as well as legal and technical information. All are available both on and off-campus. Databases relevant to the Biomedical Science programmes under review include: Ulster University staff and student may also access the USearch discovery tool which allows users to search across many of our journal databases simultaneously, saving considerable time in starting out in their research. Subject Librarians \u2013 User Support and Training To provide support to the Faculties, there are dedicated subject teams each led by a Sub- Librarian, who has cross-campus responsibilities, with Assistant Librarians on each of the three campuses. Many of the subject librarians are Fellows of the HEA. The subject teams are responsible for liaising with Schools/Departments, for obtaining Library materials in all formats, delivering effective user guidance and in providing a full information service. The subject librarians liaise closely with their faculty staff on a regular basis and, in addition, there are more formal links. For example, the Sub-Librarian represents the Library on their respective Learning and Teaching Committee. This representation helps foster close links between the Library and the relevant faculty with the aim of ensuring accurate needs assessment and effective service delivery. Two members of the Faculty of Life and Health Sciences Library team currently support the Biomedical Science programmes; both are Fellows of the HEA: Joan Atkinson, Sub Librarian, All Campuses Email: jce.atkinson@ulster.ac.uk; Telephone: +44 28 7012 4287 Cheree McGill, Assistant Librarian, Coleraine Campus Email: c.mcgill@ulster.ac.uk; Telephone: +44 28 7012 4766 However all Life and Health Sciences Library team members can provide support and can be contacted using the team email account Library-LHS@ulster.ac.uk. Through a Digital and Information Literacy Sub-Group, the Library supports and promotes academic excellence with a comprehensive plan to deliver continuous service improvement and embed the skills and expertise of Library staff in the core areas of teaching and research. The Library subject teams offer a full programme of user education which takes the form of Library induction sessions for new students, through to more in-depth, subject specialised workshops on database searching and undertaking literature reviews. Students who require individual help with dissertations or detailed subject enquiries can also make an appointment with their subject librarian for specific help or support. In delivering our information literacy programme, extensive use is made of technologies such as screencasting (e.g. Panopto) and collaborative tools (e.g. Collaborate Ultra) to engage students in their learning both on and off-campus. Further details on the range of user education provision which students on the programmes under review may avail of is provided below; please note, classes are tailored or adapted to meet the requirements of the academic: Students with Reasonable Adjustment Recommendations may also request an individual appointment with their subject librarian. If any student needs access to journal articles or book chapters not available electronically through the University Library, then they may use the Document Delivery service free of charge. Academic staff may also use the Library\u2019s centralised scanning service to provide student access to copyright material up to 10% of a work.

At present, the following Library Subject Guides would be relevant to the programmes: The Biosciences Library Guide: https://guides.library.ulster.ac.uk/biomedical The Life and Health Sciences Harvard Referencing Guide: https://guides.library.ulster.ac.uk/lhsharvard Evidence Based Practice and Systematic Reviews Library Guide: https://guides.library.ulster.ac.uk/LHS/evidence Generic to all students: The Your Library Essentials Guide can be accessed from: https://guides.library.ulster.ac.uk/libessentials Library developments The Library regards its overall service to users as the highest priority and seeks to improve services and facilities wherever possible. Recent innovations have included the launch of a self-service book issue and return service, a real-time online chat facility to support off-campus students in particular, an FAQ library knowledgebase, online booking of group study rooms and for individual support sessions for students with their subject librarian, laptop lending and enhanced book reservations. Library news is disseminated through subject blogs and by using the Library\u2019s X(formerly known as Twitter) feed. In recent times, following the significant reduction in library print holdings, space has been re- purposed in each of the campus libraries in keeping with the institutional strategy of aligning technology, space and pedagogy to create new collaborative and social learning spaces for students. 3C1a Biomedical Science UG&PG SECTION C Staff & Staff Development Staff & Staff Development The staff include specialists from the School of Biomedical Sciences that cover a range of topics, including microbiology, chemistry, haematology and immunology. Recent staff development activities of staff are noted on their CVs. The University staff development unit (http://staffdev.ulster.ac.uk/ ) provides compulsory induction programmes for all new staff, and also provides clear guidance on mentoring for academic staff in higher education. The unit offers a wide range of courses, training schemes and conferences for the continuing professional development of all staff. Also within the University the Centre for Higher Education Research & Practice https://www.ulster.ac.uk/cherp enables staff to keep informed of developments in higher education, creating opportunities for engagement with research and practice in a variety of contexts, and promoting developments across boundaries, whether within academic practice or involving collaboration with colleagues in areas of learning support. Staff also undertake a wide range of additional continuing professional development activities which includes: involvement with the management of professional bodies and societies; attendance at, participation in and running courses and conferences at regional, national and international scale; leading, collaborating, and participating in research funded by a range of national and international agencies and industry; writing papers for peer-reviewed journals, book chapters and review articles; participating in and delivery of teaching and learning seminars and workshops; attending specific training on quality and standards in teaching. On an annual basis, all staff members participate in peer reviews as to enhance the teaching and learning practice. Innovative examples of good practice are invited for dissemination at Faculty and CHERP events and through Office of Digital Learning. As indicated on the CVs the majority of core staff are active in research, and this involvement informs and enhances their teaching. Research in biosciences in the School of Biomedical Sciences, is focused within the Biomedical Sciences Research Institute (BMSRI). The BMSRI was formally established in October 2004. The BMSRI is one of 6 Research Institutes (RI) within the Faculty of Life and Health Sciences and is based on the Coleraine Campus. The BMSRI specialises in the study of the biological mechanisms (especially those which relate to gene-nutrient interactions) associated with infectious and degenerative diseases - e.g., cancer, diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis and visual deterioration. Members of the Institute are conducting pioneering research in these areas, with a determination to investigate the underlying causes, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of human infectious and degenerative diseases. Table C1: Teaching Team and Roles Matrix Use of Part-time Lecturers and Postgraduates Part-time lecturers, Visiting Professors, Recognised Teacher, and other specialist lecturers from industry provide a very valuable input to the teaching of programmes in the School. All part-time lecturers and postgraduates undergo relevant training by staff development. Postgraduates may on occasion be used to help demonstrate a particular research technique and are sometimes involved in the day-to-day supervision of student research projects. Technical, Administrative and Support-Staff In addition to the physical resources available to staff within the School of Biomedical Sciences there are also additional human resources to support teaching and learning in the form of Administrative/Secretarial Staff, technical staff, Scientific Assistants in charge of core research facilities, all of whom provide support for all aspects of teaching and learning across the general teaching laboratories and elsewhere. Administrative support for fully online programmes within the School of Biomedical Sciences Within the School of Biomedical Sciences the eLearning Support Unit specifically provides administrative support for fully online courses (such as the Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science and the Distance learning version of the BSc Hons Biomedical Science). The staff of the eLearning Support Unit is involved with a range of", "extract": "Collaborate Ultra) to engage students in their learning both on and off-campus. Further details on the range of user education provision which students on the programmes under review may avail of is provided below; please note, classes are tailored or adapted to meet the requirements of the academic: Students with Reasonable Adjustment Recommendations may also request an individual appointment with their subject librarian.", "vector": [-0.0199426282197237,

resources available to staff within the School of Biomedical Sciences there are also additional human resources to support teaching and learning in the form of Administrative/Secretarial Staff, technical staff, Scientific Assistants in charge of core research facilities, all of whom provide support for all aspects of teaching and learning across the general teaching laboratories and elsewhere. Administrative support for fully online programmes within the School of Biomedical Sciences Within the School of Biomedical Sciences the eLearning Support Unit specifically provides administrative support for fully online courses (such as the Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Science and the Distance learning version of the BSc Hons Biomedical Science). The staff of the eLearning Support Unit is involved with a range of duties related to the support of the distance learning programmes within the School including, for example: providing support to eTutors; making arrangements for guarantors for supervision of exams, liaising with potential applicants, corresponding with students regarding registration and leave of absence etc., co-ordinating the collation of marks from eTutors and Module Coordinators, putting up student announcements and release of marks on Blackboard Learn. The eLearning Support Unit Manager is also involved in servicing course committees and examination boards as well as providing advice to Course Directors with regards to University policies and procedures. eTutors Within each module e-tutors provide academic and pastoral support for a group of approximately 25 students. E-Tutors are subject specialists, many of whom work in clinical practice and/or undertake research within their discipline. The School has appointed a \u201cpool\u201d of E-tutors within each of the relevant disciplines and in a given semester if student numbers should happen to be higher than previously then another tutor from the pool can be easily taken on in order to provide appropriate support for the students. The E-tutors undertake the assessment for the students in their tutor group and their marking is moderated by the Module Coordinator. Given their subject expertise and involvement in the module, the E-tutors also contribute advice in relation to module review and update. eTutors undertake academic induction and complete the e-tutor training course prior to taking up their post. The responsibilities of an eTutor are: To function as a mentor/first point of contact for a group Regularly communicate with students in relation to queries/problems using the online learning environment \u2013 mail and discussion board tools; e-tutors are expected to spend up to six contact hours per week with students To develop a rapport with the tutor group within the online learning environment Hold online \u201creal time\u201d synchronous (chat room) or asynchronous (discussion board) tutorials as advised by the module co-ordinator Take delivery of students work \u2013 (electronically) either directly from online learning platform or the e learning support unit of Biomedical Sciences, dependent on the nature of the assessment Mark assignments/assessments within a pre-specified time in consultation with the Module coordinator Provide constructive feedback and comments to students electronically Undertake plagiarism detection on a random sample of student\u2019s work, providing a short- written report to the module co-ordinator of any cases of suspected plagiarism for further investigation; Regularly check discussion boards and e-mail within each allocated module Interact with the Programme Manager and e learning support unit in relation to non- academic issues, BBLearn access, technical problems/assignment return. Consult with the Module Co-ordinator on module/lecture content, assignment schedules and marking schemes, and any other module specific academic queries. Staff Development The CVs of the current staff in the School demonstrate that they actively pursue continuing professional training and development. This also includes involvement and representation on professional and regulatory bodies. Staff are involved in organising, presenting and attending conferences at a regional, national and international level. The School of Biomedical Sciences also uses student assessment of teaching surveys to allow teaching staff to reflect on their teaching practice. Staff within the course teams are also continuously engaged in professional development organised and run by the staff development unit at the Ulster University. On an annual basis, staff members participate in the Peer Supported Review (PSR) process. This is recorded centrally by Ulster University and is then reported to individual schools. In turn, School Teaching and Learning co-ordinators within the Faculty report to Faculty Teaching Enhancement and Research committee on School performance in PSR and their participation is recorded by the School Learning & Teaching Co-ordinator. External members of the teams also avail of such programmes and other forms of CPD within their full-time employment. CPD Programmes take several forms including: Staff development through attendance at and participation in conferences at regional, national and international scale Participation in funded collaborative or independent research Participation in and delivery of teaching and learning seminars and workshops. Specific training attended for the maintenance of quality and standards within the School such as peer review, Programme specification etc. specific training attended either internally to the university or through external organisations to facilitate the development of new skills or the upgrading of existing ones. From this information it can be seen that both internal and external staff are involved in a variety of staff developmental activity and that the process may include research, teaching, entrepreneurship and academic enterprise.

Consistent with my trajectory in education, I have provided sustained leadership across the teaching landscape, including as Module Coordinator on four modules (both undergraduate and postgraduate) and Course Director of the prestigious MSci Biomedical Science (MBiomedSci) and MSci Biological Science (MBioSci) programmes, in conjunction with Indiana University Indianapolis. I have mentored a newly appointed member of academic staff through teaching preparations, administration processes and assessments. This has enabled staff to be embedded in co-taught modules and ensured quality standards in teaching and assessment. Furthermore, I have acted as an Experienced Educator for PhD Researchers in my group who have/are currently undertaking the First Steps to Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (FST) qualification. This has involved providing critical feedback on lecture content and delivery. Indeed, with my support, a PhD Researcher in my group has recently been awarded Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA) status. Furthermore, I am a member of the Personalised Medicine team who was recently awarded a Collaborative Award for Teaching Excellence (CATE). I am primary supervisor for three PhD researchers \u2013 one recently graduated, one passed their viva in May 2024, one student is in final year and one in second year of a four-year programme. I am also co-supervisor for a PhD researcher in the School of Sport. I am passionate about developing effective supervision for PhD researchers, as evidenced by my study analysing postgraduate attitudes to supervision (McEvoy et al., 2018). I have been line manager for three postdoctoral researchers, including one ongoing. These staff members have achieved awards and recognition. For example, the current researcher was awarded PPI Seeding Funding (September 2023), nominated finalist at the NI Women\u2019s Award 2023 and featured in a University TV advertising campaign. Furthermore, I was Shortlisted for PhD Researcher Supervisor of the Year at UUSU Learning and Teaching Awards 2024.

My research seeks out a novel role of gut hormones in female reproductive function and fertility. Using female rats with high fat diet- induced obesity/diabetes and in vitro cell lines, this research will define the role of gut hormones in improved reproductive function in obesity/diabetes following RYGB surgery and evaluate the possibility of pharmacologically mimicking RYGB surgery using stable gut hormone analogues as a means of improving reproductive function in diet-induced obesity/diabetes. This research could provide key information on the mechanisms of benefit in bariatric surgery and provide the impetus to develop new avenues for the treatment of infertility in women with diabetes, obesity and PCOS. I have previously been employed as a Research Associate in the Diabetes Research Group on two different projects. From July 2014 I worked on an EFSD (European Federation for the Study of Diabetes) /Boehringer Ingelheim European Diabetes Research Programme grant, investigating the production of GIP by islet alpha cells and its role in beta cell compensatory response to pregnancy and cellular stress. From November 2015 I was employed on a Diabetes UK grant looking at novel amphibian skin peptide-analogues for the treatment of type- 2 diabetes.
